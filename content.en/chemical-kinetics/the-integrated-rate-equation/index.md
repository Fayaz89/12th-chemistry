## The integrated rate equation:
 We have just learnt that the rate of change of concentration of the reactant is directly proportional to that of concentration of the reactant. For a general reaction,

A →products

The rate law is

Rate = -d\[A\]/dt=k \[A\]<sup>x</sup>
Where k is the rate constant, and x is the order of the reaction. The above equation is a differential equation, -d\[A\]/dt , so it gives the

rate at any instant. However, using the above expression, we cannot answer questions such as how long will it take for a specific concentration of A to be used up in the reaction? What will be the concentration of

reactant after a time ‘ t ’?. To answer such questions, we need the integrated form of the above rate law which contains time as a variable.

### Integrated rate law for a first order reaction


A reaction whose rate depends on the reactant concentration raised to the first power is called a first order reaction. Let us consider the following first order reaction,

A →prosuct
 Rate law can be expressed as

Rate = k \[A\]<sup>1</sup>

Where, k is the first order rate constant. -d\[A\]/dt=k\[A\]<sup>1</sup>
⇒ = -d\[A\]/\[A\]= k dt  ...(1)

Integrate the above equation between the limits of time t = 0 and time equal to t, while the concentration varies from the initial concentration \[A<sub>0</sub> \] to \[A\] at the later time. 

 ∫<sup>\[A\]</sup> <sub>\[A<sub>0</sub>\]</sub> -d\[A<sub>0</sub>\]/\[A\]=k∫<sup>t</sup>dt 


ln(\[A<sub>0</sub>\]/\[A\]) = kt
...(2)

This equation is in natural logarithm. To convert it into usual logarithm with base 10, we have to multiply the term by 2.303.

2.303 log \[A<sub>0</sub>\]/\[A\] = kt

Equation (2) can be written in the form y = mx + c as below

⇒y = c + mx

If we follow the reaction by measuring the concentration of the reactants at regular time interval‘t’, a plot of ln\[A\] against ‘t’ yields a straight line with a negative slope.From this, the rate constant is calculated.

Examples for the first order reaction

(i) Decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide

N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(g)---> 2NO <sub>2(g) + 1/2 O<sub>2</sub>(g)
(ii) Decomposition of sulphurylchloride; SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(l)---> SO<sub>2</sub>(g)+ Cl<sub>2</sub>(g)
(iii) Decomposition of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in aqueous solution; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq)---> H<sub>2</sub>O(l)+1/2 O<sub>2</sub>(g)

(iv) Isomerisation of cyclopropane to propene.



**Pseudo first order reaction:** Kinetic study of a higher order reaction is difficult to follow, for example, in a study of a second

order reaction involving two different reactants; the simultaneous measurement of change in the concentration of both the reactants is very difficult. To overcome such difficulties, A second order reaction can be altered to a first order reaction by taking one of the reactant in large excess, such reaction is called pseudo first order reaction. Let us consider the acid hydrolysis of an ester,

  >$\ce{CH3COOHCH3(aq)+H2O(l)->[{H+}] CH3COOH(aq)+CH3OH}$

Rate = k \[CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub>\] \[H<sub>2</sub>O\]

If the reaction is carried out with the large excess of water, there is no significant change in the concentration of water during hydrolysis. i.e.,concentration of water remains almost a constant.

Now, we can define k\[H<sub>2</sub> O\] = k'; Therefore the above rate equation becomes

Rate = k'\[CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub>\]

Thus it follows first order kinetics.

### Integrated rate law for a zero order reaction:
 A reaction in which the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant over a

wide range of concentrations is called as zero order reactions. Such reactions are rare. Let us consider the following hypothetical zero order reaction.

A →product

The rate law can be written as,

Rate = k \[A\]<sup>0</sup>

−d[A]/
dt

=k (1)

∴ =(\[A\]<sup>0</sup>=1)

⇒ − d\[A\] = k dt

Integrate the above equation between the limits of \[A \] 0 at zero time and \[A\] at some later

time 't',

− ∫d\[A\] = k ∫dt 

k=\[A<sub>0</sub>\]-\[A\]/t

Equation (2) is in the form of a straight line y = mx + c

Ie., \[A\]=\[A\]/t
⇒ y = c + mx

A plot of \[A\] Vs time gives a straight line with a slope of −k and y - intercept of \[A<sub>0</sub> \].

**Examples for a zero order reaction:** 1\. Photochemical reaction between H2 and I2

 >$\ce{H2(g)+Cl2(g) ->[{hv}] 2HCL(g)}$


2\. Decomposition of N2O on hot platinum surface

N<sub>2</sub>O(g) ⇀↽N<sub>2</sub>(g)+1/2O<sub>2</sub>(g)

3\. Iodination of acetone in acid medium is

zero order with respect to iodine.
>$\ce{CH3COCH3+l2(g) ->[{h+}] ICH2COCH3+HI}$

Rate = k \[CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>\] \[H<sup>+</sup>\] 

General rate equation for a nth order reaction involving one reactant \[A\].

Rate law − =d\[A\]/dt=k\[A\]<sup>n</sup>

Consider the case in which n≠1,

integration of above equation between \[A<sub>0</sub>\] and \[A\] at time t = 0 and t = t

respectively gives 1/\[A\]<sup>n-1</sup> - 1/\[A\]<sup>n-1</sup> =(n-1)kt
