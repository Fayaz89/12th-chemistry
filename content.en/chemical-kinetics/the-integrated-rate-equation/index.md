## The integrated rate equation:
 We have just learnt that the rate of change

of concentration of the reactant is directly proportional to that of concentration of the reactant. For a general reaction,

A product  →

The rate law is

Rate = d\[A\] dt

k \[A\] −

\= _x_

Where k is the rate constant, and _x_ is the order of the reaction. The above equation is a differential equation, -d\[A\]

dt , so it gives the

rate at any instant. However, using the above expression, we cannot answer questions such as how long will it take for a specific concentration of A to be used up in the reaction? What will be the concentration of

reactant after a time ‘ t ’?. To answer such questions, we need the integrated form of the above rate law which contains time as a variable.

### Integrated rate law for a first order reaction


A reaction whose rate depends on the reactant concentration raised to the first power is called a first order reaction. Let us consider the following first order reaction,

A product  → Rate law can be expressed as

Rate = k \[A\] 1

Where, k is the first order rate constant. -d\[A\]

If we follow the reaction by measuring the concentration of the reactants at regular time interval‘t’, a plot of ln\[A\] against ‘t’ yields a straight line with a negative slope.From this, the rate constant is calculated.

**Pseudo first order reaction:** Kinetic study of a higher order reaction is difficult to follow, for example, in a study of a second

order reaction involving two different reactants; the simultaneous measurement of change in the concentration of both the reactants is very difficult. To overcome such difficulties, A second order reaction can be altered to a first order reaction by taking one of the reactant in large excess, such reaction is called pseudo first order reaction. Let us consider the acid hydrolysis of an ester,

CH COOCH (aq) H O CH COOH (aq) CH OH (aq) 3 3 2 3 3

\+  → + +

( )_l H_

Rate = k \[CH COOCH \] \[H O\] 3 3 2

If the reaction is carried out with the large excess of water, there is no significant change in the concentration of water during hydrolysis. i.e.,concentration of water remains almost a constant.

Now, we can define k \[H O\] = k' 2 ; Therefore the above rate equation becomes

Rate = k' \[CH COOCH \] 3 3

Thus it follows first order kinetics.

### Integrated rate law for a zero order reaction:
 A reaction in which the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant over a

wide range of concentrations is called as zero order reactions. Such reactions are rare. Let us consider the following hypothetical zero order reaction.

The rate law can be written as,

Ie., \[ \] \[ \]A kt A 0

⇒ y = c + mx

A plot of \[A\] Vs time gives a straight line with a slope of −k and y - intercept of \[A \] 0
