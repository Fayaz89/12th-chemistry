## Arrhenius equation – The effect of temperature on reaction rate
 Generally, the rate of a reaction increase with increasing temperature. However, there are very few exceptions. The magnitude of this increase in rate is different for different reactions. As a rough rule, for many reactions near room temperature, reaction rate tends to double when the temperature is increased by 10 C

0 .

**Activity**

Let us understand the effect of temperature on reaction rate by doing this activity. i. Take two test tubes, label them as A

and B

ii. Take 5 ml of cold water in A, add a drop of phenolphthalein indicator and then add Magnesium granules.

iii. Repeat the above with 5 ml of hot water in test tube B.

iv. Observe the two test tubes.

v. The observation shows that the solution in test tube B changes to pink colour and there is no such colour change in test tube A. That is, hot water reacts with magnesium according to the following reaction and there is no such reaction in cold water.

Mg + 2H O Mg OH H 2

vi. The resultant solution is basic and it is indicated by phenolphthalein.

A large number of reactions are known which do not take place at room temperature but occur readily at higher temperatures. Example: Reaction between H

2 and O 2 to form H O

2 takes place only when an electric spark is passed.

Arrhenius suggested that the rates of

most reactions vary with temperature in

such a way that the rate constant is directly

proportional to _e_ − 

a and he proposed

a relation between the rate constant and

temperature.

_e_ − 

....(1)

Where A the frequency factor,

R the gas constant,

E a the activation energy of the reaction

and, T the absolute temperature (in K)

The frequency factor (A) is related to the frequency of collisions (number of collisions per second) between the reactant molecules. The factor A does not vary significantly with temperature and hence it may be taken as a constant.

E a is the activation energy of the

reaction, which Arrhenius considered as the minimum energy that a molecule must have to posses to react.

constant for a reaction at two different
