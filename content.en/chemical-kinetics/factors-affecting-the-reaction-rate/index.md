## Factors affecting the reaction rate:


The rate of a reaction is affected by the following factors.

1\. Nature and state of the reactant

2\. Concentration of the reactant

3\. Surface area of the reactant

4\. Temperature of the reaction

5\. Presence of a catalyst

### Nature and state of the reactant:


We know that a chemical reaction involves breaking of certain existing bonds of the reactant and forming new bonds which lead to the product. The net energy involved in this process is dependent on the nature of the reactant and hence the rates are different for different reactants.

Let us compare the following two reactions that you carried out in volumetric analysis.

1). Redox reaction between ferrous ammonium sulphate (FAS) and KMnO

4

2). Redox reaction between oxalic acid and KMnO

4

The oxidation of oxalate ion by KMnO

4 is relatively slow compared to the

reaction between KMnO 4 and Fe

2+ . In fact heating is required for the reaction between KMnO

4 and Oxalate ion and is carried out at around 60 C

0 .

The physical state of the reactant also plays an important role to influence the rate of reactions. Gas phase reactions are faster as compared to the reactions involving solid or liquid reactants. For example, reaction of sodium metal with iodine vapours is faster

than the reaction between solid sodium and solid iodine.

Let us consider another example that you carried out in inorganic qualitative analysis of lead salts. If you mix the aqueous solution of colorless potassium iodide with the colorless solution of lead nitrate, precipitation of yellow lead iodide take place instantaneously, whereas if you mix the solid lead nitrate with solid potassium iodide, yellow coloration will appear slowly.

### Concentration of the reactants:


The rate of a reaction increases with the increase in the concentration of the reactants. The effect of concentration is explained on the basis of collision theory of reaction rates. According to this theory, the rate of a reaction depends upon the number of collisions between the reacting molecules. Higher the concentration, greater is the possibility for collision and hence the rate.

**Activity**

1\. Take three conical fl asks and label them as A, B, and C.

2\. using a burette, add 10, 20 and 40 ml of 0.1M sodium thiosulphate solution to the fl ask A, B and C respectively. And then add 40, 30 and 10 ml of distilled water to the respective fl asks so that the volume of solution in each fl ask is 50ml.

3\. Add 10 ml of 1M HCl to the conical fl ask A. Start the stop watch when half of the HCl has been added. Shake the contents carefully and place it on the tile with a cross mark as shown in the fi gure. Observe the conical fl ask from top and stop the stops watch when the cross mark just becomes invisible. Note the time.

4\. Repeat the experiment with the contents on B and C. Record the observation.

Draw a graph between 1

concentration of sodium thiosulphate. A

graph like the following one is obtained.

1

t is a direct measure of rate of

reaction and therefore, the increase in the

concentration of reactants i.e Na S O 2 2 3 ,

increases the rate.

### Eff ect of surface area of the reactant:


In heterogeneous reactions, the surface areas of the solid reactants play an important role in deciding the rate. For a given mass of a reactant, when the particle size decreases surface area increases. Increase in surface area of reactant leads to more collisions per litre per second, and hence the rate of reaction is increased.For example, powdered calcium carbonate reacts much faster with dilute HCl than with the same mass of CaCO3 as marble

**Activity**

A Known mass of marble chips are taken in a flask and a known volume of dilute HCl is added to the content, a stop clock is started when half the volume of HCl is added. The mass is noted at regular intervals until the reaction is complete. Same experiment is repeated with the same mass of powdered marble chips and the observations are recorded.

Since, carbon dioxide escapes during reaction, the mass of the flask gets lighter as the reaction proceeds. So, by measuring the flask, we can follow the rate of the reaction. A plot of loss in mass Vs time is drawn and it looks like the one as shown below.

For the powdered marble chips, the reaction is completed in less time. i.e., rate of a reaction increases when the surface area of a solid reactant is increased.

### Effect of presence of catalyst:


So far we have learnt, that rate of reaction can be increased to certain extent by increasing the concentration, temperature and surface area of the reactant. However significant changes in the reaction can be brought out by the addition of a substance called catalyst. A catalyst is substance which alters the rate of a reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. They may participate in the reaction, but again regenerated at the end of the reaction. In the presence of a catalyst, the energy of activation is lowered and hence, greater number of molecules can cross the energy barrier and change over to products, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.

**Summary**

„ Chemical kinetics is the study of the rate and the mechanism of chemical reactions, proceeding under given conditions of temperature, pressure, concentration etc.

„ The change in the concentration of the species involved in a chemical reaction per unit time gives the rate of a reaction.

„ The rate of the reaction, at a particular instant during the reaction is called the instantaneous rate. The shorter the time period, we choose, the closer we approach to the instantaneous rate,

„ The rate represents the speed at which the reactants are converted into products at any instant.

„ The rate constant is a proportionality constant and It is equal to the rate of reaction, when the concentration of each of the reactants is unity.

„ Molecularity of a reaction is the total number of reactant species that are involved in an elementary step.

„ The half life of a reaction is defined as the time required for the reactant concentration to reach one half its initial value. For a first order reaction, the half life is a constant

**Activity**

Take two test tubes and label them as A and B. Add 7 ml of 0.1N oxalic acid solution, 5 ml of 0.1N KMnO

4 solution and 5 ml of 2N dilute H SO 2 4 in both the test tubes. The colour

of the solution is pink in both the test tubes.

Now add few crystals of manganese sulphate to the content in test tube A. the pink colour fades up and disappears. In this case, MnSO

4 acts as a catalyst and increases the rate of oxidation of C O by MnO

**Chemical kinetics in pharmaceuticals**

Chemical kinetics has many applications in the field of pharmaceuticals. It is used to study the lifetimes and bioavailability of drugs within the body and this branch of study is called **pharmacokinetics** Doctors usually prescribe drugs to be taken at different times of the day. i.e.some drugs are to be taken twice a day, while others

are taken three times a day, or just once a day. Pharmacokinetic studies is used to determine the prescription (dosage and frequency). For example, Paracetamol is a well known anti-pyretic and analgesic that is prescribed in cases of fever and body pain. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that Paracetamol has a half-life of 2.5 hours within the body i.e.the plasma concentration of a drug is halved after 2.5 hrs. After 10 hours (4 half-lives)only 6.25 % of drug remains. Based on such studies the dosage and frequency will be decided. In case of paracetamol, it is usually prescribed to take once in 6 hours depending upon the conditions.

i.e., it does not depend on the initial concentration. „ According to collision theory, chemical reactions occur as a result of collisions

between the reacting molecules. „ Generally, the rate of a reaction increase with increasing temperature. However,

there are very few exceptions. The magnitude of this increase in rate is different for different reactions. As a rough rule, for many reactions near room temperature, reaction rate tends to double when the temperature is increased by 10 C

0 . „ According to Arrhenius, activation energy of the reaction is the minimum energy

that a molecule must have to posses to react. „ The rate of a reaction is affected by the following factors.

1\. Nature and state of the reactant

2\. Concentration of the reactant

3\. Surface area of the reactant

4\. Temperature of the reaction

5\. Presence of a catalyst

**CHEMICAL KINETICS**

**Steps**

• Open the Browser and type the URL given (or) Scan the QR Code. You can see a webpage which displays the java applet called reactions and rates. You can click it and you will get a window as shown in the figure. This applet contains three modules which can be selected by clicking the appropriate tab (box1).

• Select single collision tab (tab 1) to visualise collision between two molecules. You can visualise the progress of the reaction (box 5) by varying the temperature using the slider (box 2). You can visualise that the raise in temperature, will raise the energy of the system and allows the reactants to cross the energy barrier to form products. You can repeat this simulation with more molecules in the many collisions tab (box 1).

• You can also perform virtual kinetic experiment, using rate experiments mode. Choose the types reacting molecules and their stoichiometry using the options provided (box 2). The number of reactant and product molecules at a given time will be displayed in panel (box-3). You can see the effect of temperature on reaction rate by varying the temperature (box 4).

By using this tool you can understand collision and the activation energy. You can also perform virtual kinetic experiment to understand the eff ect of temperature on reaction rate.
