**Svante August Arrhenius (1859 –1927)**

Svante August Arrhenius was a Swedish scientist. Arrhenius was one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry. He focused his attention on the conductivities of electrolytes. He proposed that crystalline salts dissociate into paired charged ions when dissolved in water, for which he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. He also proposed defi nitions for acids and bases. He formulated the concept of activation energy.

**INTRODUCTION**

We have already learnt in XI standard that the feasibility of a chemical reaction under a given set of conditions can be predicted, using the principles of thermodynamics. However, thermodynamics does not provide an answer to a very important question of how fast a chemical reaction takes place. We know from our practical experience that all chemical reactions take some time for completion. Reaction speeds ranging from extremely fast (in femto seconds) to extremely slow (in years). For example, when the reactants BaCl2 solution and dilute H2SO4 are just mixed, a white precipitate of BaSO4 is immediately formed; on the other hand reactions such as rusting of Iron take many years to complete. The answers to the questions such as (i) how fast a chemical change can occur and (ii) What happens in a chemical reaction during the period between the initial stage and final stage are provided by the chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word “kinesis” meaning movement.

Chemical kinetics is the study of the rate and the mechanism of chemical reactions, proceeding under given conditions of temperature, pressure, concentration etc.

The study of chemical kinetics not only help us to determine the rate of a chemical reaction, but also useful in optimizing the process conditions of industrial manufacturing processes, organic and inorganic synthesis etc.

In this unit, we discuss the rate of a chemical reaction and the factors affecting it. We also discuss the theories of the reaction rate and temperature dependence of a chemical reaction.

## Rate of a chemical reaction:
 A rate is a change in a particular

variable per unit time. You have already learnt in physics that change in the displacement of a particle per unit time gives its velocity. Similarly in a chemical reaction, the change in the concentration of the species involved in a chemical reaction per unit time gives the rate of a reaction.

Let us consider a simple general reaction

_A B_  → The concentration of the reactant

(\[A\]) can be measured at different time intervals. Let the concentration of A at two different times 2t and 2t , (t2>t1) be \[A1\] and \[A2\] respectively. The rate of the reaction can be expressed as

Rate=

– \[Change in the concentration of the reactants\] (Change in time)

i.e., Rate A A

t 2 1

\= =  

 

**\-** (\[ \] \[ \]) ( )

_\-_ ∆ ∆  

...(7.1)

During the reaction, the concentration of the reactant decreases i.e. \[A \]2 < \[A \]1 and hence the change in concentration \[A \] \[A \]2 1- gives a negative value. By convention the reaction rate is a positive one and hence a negative sign is introduced in the rate expression (equation 7.1)

If the reaction is followed by measuring

the product concentration, the rate is given

by ∆ ∆ \[B\]

is required here.

**Unit of rate of a reaction:**

unit of rate = unit of concentration unit of time

Usually, concentration is expressed in number of moles per litre and time is expressed in seconds and therefore the unit of the rate of a reaction is mol L s-1 -1 . Depending upon the nature of the reaction, minute, hour, year etc can also be used.

For a gas phase reaction, the concentration of the gaseous species is usually expressed in terms of their partial pressures and in such cases the unit of reaction rate is atm s-1 .

### Stoichiometry and rate of a reaction:


In a reaction A B  → , the stoichiometry of both reactant and product are same, and hence the rate of disappearance of reactant (A) and the rate of appearance of product (B) are same.

Now, let us consider a different reaction

A 2B  →

In this case, for every mole of A, that disappears two moles of B appear, i.e., the rate of formation of B is twice as fast as the rate of disappearance of A. therefore, the rate of the reaction can be expressed as below

Rate = + d\[B\] dt

\-d\[A\] dt

\=  

 

2

In other words,

Rate = -d\[A\] dt

d\[B\] dt

\= 1 2

For a general reaction, the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate of consumption of a reactant (or formation of a product) divided by its coefficient in the balanced equation

### Average and instantaneous rate:


Let us understand the average rate and instantaneous rate by considering the isomerisation of cyclopropane.

780 K

cyclopropane propene

The kinetics of the above reaction is followed by measuring the concentration of cyclopropane at regular intervals and the observations are shown below. (Table 7.1)

**Table 7.1 Concentration of cyclopropane at various times during its isomerisation at 780K**

It means that during the first 30 minutes of the reaction, the concentration of the reactant ( cyclo propane) decreases as an average of 4.36 10 mol L -2 -1× each minute.

Let us calculate the average rate for an initial and later stage over a short period.

\= 0.29 10

\= 2.9 x

10 mol L min-2 -1 -1

From the above calculations, we come to know that the rate decreases with time as the reaction proceeds and the average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of the reaction at any instant. The rate of the reaction, at a particular instant during the reaction is called the instantaneous rate. The shorter the time period, we choose, the closer we approach to the instantaneous rate,

As t 0; - cyclopropane

t = -d\[cyclopropane\]

∆ → ∆

A plot of \[cyclopropane\] Vs (time)

gives a curve as shown in the figure 7.2.

Instantaneous rate at a particular instant ‘t ’ -d \[cyclopropane\]

dt is obtained by calculating

the slope of a tangent drawn to the curve at

that instant.

In general, the instantaneous reaction rate at a moment of mixing the reactants (t = 0) is calculated from the slope of the tangent drawn to the curve. The rate calculated by this method is called initial rate of a reaction.

Let us calculate the instantaneous rate of isomerisation cyclopropane at different concentrations: 2 M, 1M and 0.5 M from the graph shown in fig 7.2, the results obtained are tabulated below.

**Table 7.2 Rate of isomerisation**

## Rate law and rate constant:
 We have just learnt that, the rate of the

reaction depends upon the concentration of the reactant. Now let us understand how the reaction rate is related to concentration by considering the following general reaction.

_x y_A + B products  →

The rate law for the above reaction is generally expressed as

Rate = k \[A\] \[B\]m n

Where k is proportionality constant called the rate constant. The values of m and n represent the reaction order with respect to A and B respectively. The overall order of the reaction is given by (m+n). The values of the exponents (m and n) in the rate law must be determined by experiment. They cannot be deduced from the Stoichiometry of the reaction. For example, consider the isomerisation of cyclopropane, that we discussed earlier.

The results shown in table 7.2 indicate that if the concentration of cyclopropane is reduced to half, the rate also reduced to half. It means that the rate depends upon \[cyclopropane\] raised to the first power

i.e., Rate = k\[cyclopropane\]1

It does not depend on the initial concentration of reactants.

## Molecularity:
 Kinetic studies involve not only

measurement of a rate of reaction but also proposal of a reasonable reaction mechanism. Each and every single step in a reaction mechanism is called an elementary reaction.

An elementary step is characterized by its molecularity. The total number of reactant species that are involved in an elementary step is called molecularity of that particular step. Let us recall the hydrolysis of t-butyl bromide studied in XI standard. Since the rate determining elementary step involves only t-butyl bromide, the reaction is called a Unimolecular Nucleophilic substitution (S )

## The integrated rate equation:
 We have just learnt that the rate of change

of concentration of the reactant is directly proportional to that of concentration of the reactant. For a general reaction,

A product  →

The rate law is

Rate = d\[A\] dt

k \[A\] −

\= _x_

Where k is the rate constant, and _x_ is the order of the reaction. The above equation is a differential equation, -d\[A\]

dt , so it gives the

rate at any instant. However, using the above expression, we cannot answer questions such as how long will it take for a specific concentration of A to be used up in the reaction? What will be the concentration of

reactant after a time ‘ t ’?. To answer such questions, we need the integrated form of the above rate law which contains time as a variable.

### Integrated rate law for a first order reaction


A reaction whose rate depends on the reactant concentration raised to the first power is called a first order reaction. Let us consider the following first order reaction,

A product  → Rate law can be expressed as

Rate = k \[A\] 1

Where, k is the first order rate constant. -d\[A\]

**Pseudo first order reaction:** Kinetic study of a higher order reaction is difficult to follow, for example, in a study of a second

order reaction involving two different reactants; the simultaneous measurement of change in the concentration of both the reactants is very difficult. To overcome such difficulties, A second order reaction can be altered to a first order reaction by taking one of the reactant in large excess, such reaction is called pseudo first order reaction. Let us consider the acid hydrolysis of an ester,

CH COOCH (aq) H O CH COOH (aq) CH OH (aq) 3 3 2 3 3

\+  → + +

( )_l H_

Rate = k \[CH COOCH \] \[H O\] 3 3 2

If the reaction is carried out with the large excess of water, there is no significant change in the concentration of water during hydrolysis. i.e.,concentration of water remains almost a constant.

Now, we can define k \[H O\] = k' 2 ; Therefore the above rate equation becomes

Rate = k' \[CH COOCH \] 3 3

Thus it follows first order kinetics.

### Integrated rate law for a zero order reaction:
 A reaction in which the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant over a

wide range of concentrations is called as zero order reactions. Such reactions are rare. Let us consider the following hypothetical zero order reaction.

The rate law can be written as,

## Half life period of a reaction:
 The half life of a reaction is defined

as the time required for the reactant concentration to reach one half its initial value. For a first order reaction, the half life is a constant i.e., it does not depend on the initial concentration.

## Collision theory :
 Collision Theory was proposed

independently by Max Trautz in 1916 and William Lewis in 1918. This theory is based on the kinetic theory of gases. According to this theory, chemical reactions occur as a result of collisions between the reacting molecules. Let us understand this theory by considering the following reaction.

A (g) + B (g) 2AB(g) 2 2

If we consider that, the reaction between A

2 and B 2 molecules proceeds

through collisions between them, then the rate would be proportional to the number of collisions per second.

Rate ∝ number of molecules colliding per litre per second (collision rate)

The number of collisions is directly proportional to the concentration of both A

2 and B 2 .

Collision rate ∝ \[A \]\[B \] 2 2

Collision rate = Z \[A \]\[B \] 2 2

Where, Z is a constant.

The collision rate in gases can be calculated from kinetic theory of gases. For a gas at room temperature (298K) and 1 atm pressure, each molecule undergoes approximately 10

9

collisions per second, i.e., 1 collision in 10

9- second. Thus, if every collision resulted in reaction, the reaction would be complete in 10

9- second. In actual practice this does not happen. It implies that all collisions

are not effective to lead to the reaction. In order to react, the colliding molecules must possess a minimum energy called activation energy. The molecules that collide with less energy than activation energy will remain intact and no reaction occurs.

Fraction of effective collisions (f) is given by the following expression

_f e Ea RT_\= −

To understand the magnitude of collision factor (f), Let us calculate the collision factor (f) for a reaction having activation energy of 1100 kJ mol− at 300K.

orientation factor i.e., even if the reactant collide with sufficient energy, they will not react unless the orientation of the reactant molecules is suitable for the formation of the transition state.

The figure 7. 6 illustrates the importance of proper alignment of molecules which leads to reaction.

## Arrhenius equation – The effect of temperature on reaction rate
 Generally, the rate of a reaction

increase with increasing temperature. However, there are very few exceptions. The magnitude of this increase in rate is different for different reactions. As a rough rule, for many reactions near room temperature, reaction rate tends to double when the temperature is increased by 10 C

0 .

A large number of reactions are known which do not take place at room temperature but occur readily at higher temperatures. Example: Reaction between H

2 and O 2 to form H O

2 takes place only when an electric spark is passed.

The frequency factor (A) is related to the frequency of collisions (number of collisions per second) between the reactant molecules. The factor A does not vary significantly with temperature and hence it may be taken as a constant.

E a is the activation energy of the

reaction, which Arrhenius considered as the minimum energy that a molecule must have to posses to react.

## Factors affecting the reaction rate:


The rate of a reaction is affected by the following factors.

1\. Nature and state of the reactant

2\. Concentration of the reactant

3\. Surface area of the reactant

4\. Temperature of the reaction

5\. Presence of a catalyst

### Nature and state of the reactant:


We know that a chemical reaction involves breaking of certain existing bonds of the reactant and forming new bonds which lead to the product. The net energy involved in this process is dependent on the nature of the reactant and hence the rates are different for different reactants.

Let us compare the following two reactions that you carried out in volumetric analysis.

1). Redox reaction between ferrous ammonium sulphate (FAS) and KMnO

4

2). Redox reaction between oxalic acid and KMnO

4

The oxidation of oxalate ion by KMnO

4 is relatively slow compared to the

reaction between KMnO 4 and Fe

2+ . In fact heating is required for the reaction between KMnO

4 and Oxalate ion and is carried out at around 60 C

0 .

The physical state of the reactant also plays an important role to influence the rate of reactions. Gas phase reactions are faster as compared to the reactions involving solid or liquid reactants. For example, reaction of sodium metal with iodine vapours is faster

than the reaction between solid sodium and solid iodine.

Let us consider another example that you carried out in inorganic qualitative analysis of lead salts. If you mix the aqueous solution of colorless potassium iodide with the colorless solution of lead nitrate, precipitation of yellow lead iodide take place instantaneously, whereas if you mix the solid lead nitrate with solid potassium iodide, yellow coloration will appear slowly.

### Concentration of the reactants:


The rate of a reaction increases with the increase in the concentration of the reactants. The effect of concentration is explained on the basis of collision theory of reaction rates. According to this theory, the rate of a reaction depends upon the number of collisions between the reacting molecules. Higher the concentration, greater is the possibility for collision and hence the rate.

**Activity**

1\. Take three conical fl asks and label them as A, B, and C.

2\. using a burette, add 10, 20 and 40 ml of 0.1M sodium thiosulphate solution to the fl ask A, B and C respectively. And then add 40, 30 and 10 ml of distilled water to the respective fl asks so that the volume of solution in each fl ask is 50ml.

3\. Add 10 ml of 1M HCl to the conical fl ask A. Start the stop watch when half of the HCl has been added. Shake the contents carefully and place it on the tile with a cross mark as shown in the fi gure. Observe the conical fl ask from top and stop the stops watch when the cross mark just becomes invisible. Note the time.

4\. Repeat the experiment with the contents on B and C. Record the observation.

C 40 10 0.08

Draw a graph between 1

concentration of sodium thiosulphate. A

graph like the following one is obtained.

1

t is a direct measure of rate of

reaction and therefore, the increase in the

concentration of reactants i.e Na S O 2 2 3 ,

increases the rate.

### Eff ect of surface area of the reactant:


In heterogeneous reactions, the surface areas of the solid reactants play an important role in deciding the rate. For a given mass of a reactant, when the particle size decreases surface area increases. Increase in surface area of reactant leads to more collisions per litre per second, and hence the rate of reaction is increased.For example, powdered calcium carbonate reacts much faster with dilute HCl than with the same mass of CaCO3 as marble

Since, carbon dioxide escapes during reaction, the mass of the flask gets lighter as the reaction proceeds. So, by measuring the flask, we can follow the rate of the reaction. A plot of loss in mass Vs time is drawn and it looks like the one as shown below.

For the powdered marble chips, the reaction is completed in less time. i.e., rate of a reaction increases when the surface area of a solid reactant is increased.

### Effect of presence of catalyst:


So far we have learnt, that rate of reaction can be increased to certain extent by increasing the concentration, temperature and surface area of the reactant. However significant changes in the reaction can be brought out by the addition of a substance called catalyst. A catalyst is substance which alters the rate of a reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. They may participate in the reaction, but again regenerated at the end of the reaction. In the presence of a catalyst, the energy of activation is lowered and hence, greater number of molecules can cross the energy barrier and change over to products, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction.

**Summary**

„ Chemical kinetics is the study of the rate and the mechanism of chemical reactions, proceeding under given conditions of temperature, pressure, concentration etc.

„ The change in the concentration of the species involved in a chemical reaction per unit time gives the rate of a reaction.

„ The rate of the reaction, at a particular instant during the reaction is called the instantaneous rate. The shorter the time period, we choose, the closer we approach to the instantaneous rate,

„ The rate represents the speed at which the reactants are converted into products at any instant.

„ The rate constant is a proportionality constant and It is equal to the rate of reaction, when the concentration of each of the reactants is unity.

„ Molecularity of a reaction is the total number of reactant species that are involved in an elementary step.

„ The half life of a reaction is defined as the time required for the reactant concentration to reach one half its initial value. For a first order reaction, the half life is a constant

**Activity**

Take two test tubes and label them as A and B. Add 7 ml of 0.1N oxalic acid solution, 5 ml of 0.1N KMnO

4 solution and 5 ml of 2N dilute H SO 2 4 in both the test tubes. The colour

of the solution is pink in both the test tubes.

Now add few crystals of manganese sulphate to the content in test tube A. the pink colour fades up and disappears. In this case, MnSO

4 acts as a catalyst and increases the rate of oxidation of C O by MnO

**Chemical kinetics in pharmaceuticals**

Chemical kinetics has many applications in the field of pharmaceuticals. It is used to study the lifetimes and bioavailability of drugs within the body and this branch of study is called **pharmacokinetics** Doctors usually prescribe drugs to be taken at different times of the day. i.e.some drugs are to be taken twice a day, while others

are taken three times a day, or just once a day. Pharmacokinetic studies is used to determine the prescription (dosage and frequency). For example, Paracetamol is a well known anti-pyretic and analgesic that is prescribed in cases of fever and body pain. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that Paracetamol has a half-life of 2.5 hours within the body i.e.the plasma concentration of a drug is halved after 2.5 hrs. After 10 hours (4 half-lives)only 6.25 % of drug remains. Based on such studies the dosage and frequency will be decided. In case of paracetamol, it is usually prescribed to take once in 6 hours depending upon the conditions.

i.e., it does not depend on the initial concentration. „ According to collision theory, chemical reactions occur as a result of collisions

between the reacting molecules. „ Generally, the rate of a reaction increase with increasing temperature. However,

there are very few exceptions. The magnitude of this increase in rate is different for different reactions. As a rough rule, for many reactions near room temperature, reaction rate tends to double when the temperature is increased by 10 C

0 . „ According to Arrhenius, activation energy of the reaction is the minimum energy

that a molecule must have to posses to react. „ The rate of a reaction is affected by the following factors.

1\. Nature and state of the reactant

2\. Concentration of the reactant

3\. Surface area of the reactant

4\. Temperature of the reaction

5\. Presence of a catalyst
