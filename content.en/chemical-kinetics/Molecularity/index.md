## Molecularity:
 Kinetic studies involve not only measurement of a rate of reaction but also proposal of a reasonable reaction mechanism. Each and every single step in a reaction mechanism is called an elementary reaction.

An elementary step is characterized by its molecularity. The total number of reactant species that are involved in an elementary step is called molecularity of that particular step. Let us recall the hydrolysis of t-butyl bromide studied in XI standard. Since the rate determining elementary step involves only t-butyl bromide, the reaction is called a Unimolecular Nucleophilic substitution (S)<sup>
1 </sup><sub>
N </sub> reaction.

Let us understand the elementary reactions by considering another reaction, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalysed by I− .

2 H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> (aq)→ H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>(g) 


It is experimentally found that the reaction is first order with respect to both

H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and I, which indicates that I− is also involved in the reaction. The mechanism involves the following steps.

**Step:1** H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq) + I<sup>-</sup> (aq)→ H<sub>2</sub>O(l) +OI<sup>-</sup>(aq)

**Step : 2** H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (aq) + OI<sup>-</sup> (aq)→ H<sub>2</sub> O(l)+ I<sup>-</sup> (aq) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)


Overall reaction is

2H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>(aq)→ 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)+ O<sub>2</sub>(g) 


These two reactions are elementary reactions. Adding equ (1) and (2) gives the overall reaction. Step 1 is the rate determining step, since it involves both H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and I<sup>-</sup>
, the overall reaction is bimolecular.

**Differences between order and molecularity:**

**Example 1**

Consider the oxidation of nitric oxide to form NO<sub>2</sub>

2NO(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)→ 2NO<sub>2</sub>(g)

(a). Express the rate of the reaction in terms of changes in the concentration of NO,O<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>

(b). At a particular instant, when \[O<sub>2</sub> \] is

decreasing at 0.2 mol L<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at what rate is

\[NO<sub>2</sub> \]increasing at that instant?

**Solution:**

a) Rate= - 1d\[NO\]/2
dt = \- d\[O<sub>2</sub> \]/dt= 1d\[NO<sub>2</sub> \]/2dt

b) -d\[O<sub>2</sub> \]/dt= 1 d\[NO<sub>2</sub> \]/2dt=d\[NO<sub>2</sub> \]/dt=

2x{-d\[O<sub>2</sub> \]/
dt} =2x 0.2mol L<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> = 

0.4 mol L<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>

1). Write the rate expression for the following reactions, assuming them as elementary reactions.

i) 3A + 5B<sub>2</sub> →4CD 

ii) X<sub>2</sub> + Y<sub>2</sub>→ 2XY


2). Consider the decomposition of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(g) to form NO (g) 2 and O (g). At a particular instant N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>disappears at a rate of 2.5 x 10<sup>-2</sup>mol dm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. At what rates are NO<sub>2</sub>
and O<sub>2</sub> formed? What is the

rate of the reaction?

**Example 2**

1\. What is the order with respect to each of the reactant and overall order of the following reactions?

(a).5Br<sup>-</sup>(aq)+ BrO<sub>3</sub>(aq)+ 6H<sup>+</sup>(aq) → 3Br<sub>2</sub>(l)+3H<sub>2</sub>O(l)

The experimental rate law is

Rate = k \[Br<sup>-</sup> \]\[ BrO<sub>3</sub> \]\[ HBr<sup>+</sup>\]<sup>2</sup>

(b).the experimental rate law is

Rate = k\[ CH <sub>3</sub>CHO\]<sup>3/2</sup>

**Solution:**

a) First order with respect to Br −, first

order with respect to BrO<sub>3</sub>
and second order with respect to H<sup>+</sup> . Hence the overall order of the reaction is equal to 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

b) Order of the reaction with respect to acetaldehyde is
3/2 and overall order is
also 3/2

**Example 3**

2\. The rate of the reaction x + 2y product→ is 4 x10<sup>-3</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
, if \[x\]=\[y\]=0.2 M and rate constant at 400K is 2 x 10<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, What is the overall order of the reaction.

**Solution :** Rate = k \[x\]<sup>n</sup> \[y\]<sup>m</sup>
4 x10<sup>-3</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>=2 x10<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>(0.2 mol L<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>n</sup>(0.2 mol L<sup>-1</sup>) <sup>m</sup>
4 x10<sup>-3</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>/
2 x10 <sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
=(0.2) mol L<sup>n+m</sup> (mol L<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>n+m</sup>
0.2 ( mol L<sup>-1</sup>)= (0.2)<sup>n+m</sup>(mol L <sup>-1</sup>)<sup>n+m</sup>

Comparing the powers on both sides

The overall order of the reaction n + m = 1
