## Half life period of a reaction:
 The half life of a reaction is defined

as the time required for the reactant concentration to reach one half its initial value. For a first order reaction, the half life is a constant i.e., it does not depend on the initial concentration.

The rate constant for a first order reaction is given by

Hence, in contrast to the half life of a first order reaction, the half life of a zero order reaction is directly proportional to the initial concentration of the reactant.
