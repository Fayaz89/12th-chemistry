**Alfred Werner (1866 –1919)**

Alfred Werner was a Swiss chemist who explainedthe bonding in coordination complexes. Werner proposed his coordination theory in 1893. It must be remembered that this imaginative theory was proposed before the electron had been discovered by J.J. Th ompson in 1896. Werner did not have any modern instrumental techniques at his time and all his studies were made using simple reaction chemistry. Complexes must have been a complete mystery without any knowledge of bonding or structure. Th is theory and his painstaking work over the next 20 years won Alfred Werner the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1913.He was the fi rst inorganic chemist to win the Nobel Prize.

**INTRODUCTION**

We have already learnt in the previous unit that the transition metals have a tendency to form complexes (**coordination compounds)**. The name is derived from the Latin words '_complexus'_ and _'coordinate'_ which mean _'hold'_ and _'to arrange'_ respectively. The complexes of transition metals have interesting properties and differ from simple ionic and covalent compounds. For example, chromium(III)chloride hexahydrate, CrCl3.6H2O, exists as purple, pale green or dark green compound. In addition to metals, certain non metals also form coordination compounds but have less tendency than d block elements. Coordination compounds play a vital role in the biological functions, and have wide range of catalytic applications in chemical industries. For example, haemoglobin, the oxygen transporter of human is a coordination compound of iron, and cobalamine, an essential vitamin is a coordination compound of cobalt. Chlorophyll, a pigment present in plants acting as a photo sensitiser in the photosynthesis is also a coordination compound. Various coordination compounds such as Wilkinson's compound, Ziegler Natta compound are used as catalysts in industrial processes. Hence, it is important to understand the chemistry of coordination compounds. In this unit we study the nature, bonding, nomenclature, isomerism and applications of the coordination compounds.

## Coordination compounds and double salts:
 When two or more stable compounds in solution are mixed together and allowed

to evaporate, in certain cases there is a possibility for the formation of double salts or coordination compounds. For example when an equimolar solution of ferrous sulphate and ammonium sulphate are mixed and allowed to crystallise, a double salt namely Mohr's salt (Ferrous ammonium sulphate, FeSO4.(NH4)2SO4.6H2O) is formed. Let us recall the blood red colour formation in the inorganic qualitative analysis of ferric ion, the reaction between ferric chloride and potassium thiocyanate solution gives a blood red coloured coordination compound, potassium ferrithiocyanate K3\[Fe(SCN)6\]. If we perform a qualitative analysis to identify the constituent ions present in both the compounds, Mohr's salt answers the presence of Fe2+ ,NH4

\+ and SO4 2-ions, whereas the

potassium ferrithiocyanate will not answer Fe3+ and SCN-ions. From this we can infer that the double salts lose their identity and dissociates into their constituent simple ions in solutions , whereas the complex ion in coordination compound, does not loose its identity and never dissociate to give simple ions.

## Werner's theory of coordination compounds:


Swiss chemist Alfred Werner was the first one to propose a theory of coordination compounds to explain the observed behaviour of them.

Let us consider the different coloured complexes of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia which exhibit different properties as shown below.

**Complex Colour No. of moles of AgCl precipitated on reaction of**

**one mole of complex with excess Ag+**

**Yellow** 3

**CoCl3.5NH3 Purple** 2

**trans - CoCl3.4NH3 Green** 1

**cis - CoCl3.4NH3 Violet** 1

In this case, the valences of the elements present in both the reacting molecules, cobalt(III) chloride and ammonia are completely satisfi ed. Yet these substances react to form the above mentioned complexes.

**To explain this behaviour Werner postulated his theory as follows** 1\. Most of the elements exhibit, two types of valence namely primary valence and secondary

valence and each element tend to satisfy both the valences.In modern terminology, the primary valence is referred as the oxidation state of the metal atom and the secondary valence as the coordination number. For example, according to Werner, the primary and secondary valences of cobalt are 3 and 6 respectively.

2\. Th e primary valence of a metal ion is positive in most of the cases and zero in certain cases. Th ey are always satisfi ed by negative ions. For example in the complex CoCl3.6NH3, Th e primary valence of Co is +3 and is satisfi ed by 3Cl- ions.

3\. Th e secondary valence is satisfi ed by negative ions, neutral molecules, positive ions or the combination of these. For example, in CoCl3.6NH3 the secondary valence of cobalt is 6 and is satisfi ed by six neutral ammonia molecules, whereas in CoCl3.5NH3 the secondary valence of cobalt is satisfi ed by fi ve neutral ammonia molecules and a Cl- ion.

4\. According to Werner, there are two spheres of attraction around a metal atom/ion in a complex. Th e inner sphere is known as coordination sphere and the groups present in this sphere are fi rmly attached to the metal. Th e outer sphere is called ionisation sphere. Th e groups present in this sphere are loosely bound to the central metal ion and hence can be separated into ions upon dissolving the complex in a suitable solvent.

1\. The primary valences are non-directional while the secondary valences are directional. The geometry of the complex is determined by the spacial arrangement of the groups which satisfy the secondary valence. For example, if a metal ion has a secondary valence of six, it has an octahedral geometry. If the secondary valence is 4, it has either tetrahedral or square planar geometry.

The following table illustrates the Werner's postulates.

### Limitations of Werner’s theory:


Even though, Werner’s theory was able to explain a number of properties of coordination compounds, it does not explain their colour and the magnetic properties.

**Evaluate yourself 1:**

When a coordination compound CrCl3.4H2O is mixed with silver nitrate solution, one mole of silver chloride is precipitated per mole of the compound. There are no free solvent molecules in that compound. Assign the secondary valence to the metal and write the structural formula of the compound.

## Definition of important terms pertaining to co-ordination compounds 5.3.1 Coordination entity:


Coordination entity is an ion or a neutral molecule, composed of a central atom, usually a metal and the array of other atoms or groups of atoms (ligands) that are attached to it. In the formula, the coordination entity is enclosed in square brackets. For example, in potassium ferrocyanide, K4\[Fe(CN)6\], the coordination entity is \[Fe(CN)6\]

4-. In nickel tetracarbonyl, the coordination entity is \[Ni(CO)4\].

### Central atom/ion:


The central atom/ion is the one that occupies the central position in a coordination entity and binds other atoms or groups of atoms (ligands) to itself, through a coordinate

covalent bond. For example, in K4\[Fe(CN)6\], the central metal ion is Fe2+. In the coordination entity \[Fe(CN)6\]

4-, the Fe2+ accepts an electron pair from each ligand, CN- and thereby forming six coordinate covalent bonds with them. since, the central metal ion has an ability to accept electron pairs, it is referred to as a Lewis acid.

### Ligands:


The ligands are the atoms or groups of atoms bound to the central atom/ion. The atom in a ligand that is bound directly to the central metal atom is known as a donor atom. For example, in K4\[Fe(CN)6\], the ligand is CN- ion, but the donor atom is carbon and in \[Co(NH3)6\]Cl3 the ligand is NH3 molecule and the donor atom is nitrogen.

**Coordination sphere:**

The complex ion of the coordination compound containing the central metal atom/ion and the ligands attached to it, is collectively called coordination sphere and are usually enclosed in square brackets with the net charge. The other ionisable ions, are written outside the bracket are called counter ions. For example, the coordination compound K4\[Fe(CN)6\] contains the complex ion \[Fe(CN)6\]

4- and is referred as the coordination sphere. The other associated ion K+ is called the counter ion.

**Coordination polyhedron:** The three dimensional spacial arrangement of ligand atoms/ions that are directly attached

to the central atom is known as the coordination polyhedron (or polygon). For example, in K4\[Fe(CN)6\], the coordination polyhedra is octrahedral. The coordination polyhedra of \[Ni(CO)4\] is tetrahedral.

**Coordination number:**

The number of ligand donor atoms bonded to a central metal ion in a complex is called the coordination number of the metal. In other words, the coordination number is equal to the number of σ-bonds between ligands and the central atom.

**For example,**

i. In K4\[Fe(CN)6\], the coordination number of Fe2+ is 6.

ii. In \[Ni(en)3\]Cl2, the coordination number of Ni2+ is also 6. Here the ligand 'en' represents ethane-1,2-diamine (NH2-CH2-CH2-NH2) and it contains two donor atoms (Nitrogen) Each ligand forms two coordination bonds with nickel. So,totally there are six coordination bonds between them.

**Oxidation state (number):** The oxidation state of a central atom in a coordination entity is defined as the

charge it would bear if all the ligands were removed along with the electron pairs that were shared with the central atom. In naming a complex, it is represented by a Roman numeral. For example, in the coordination entity \[Fe(CN)6\]

4-, the oxidation state of iron is represented as (II). The net charge on the complex ion is equal to the sum of

XII U5 Coordination jagan.indd 134 2/19/2020 4:40:43 PM

135

the oxidation state of the central metal and the charge the on the ligands attached to it. Using this relation the oxidation number can be calculated as follows

Net charge = (oxidation state of the central metal) + \[(No. of ligands) X (charge on the ligand)\]

**Example 1:**

In \[Fe(CN)6\] 4-

, let the oxidation number of iron is x :

The net charge: -4 = x + 6 (-1) => x = +2

**Example 2:**

In \[Co(NH3)5Cl\]2+ , let the oxidation number of cobalt is x :

The net charge: +2 = x + 5 (0) + 1 (-1) => x = +3

**Evaluate yourself 2:**

2\. In the complex, \[Pt(NO2)(H2O)(NH3)2\]Br , identify the following

i. Central metal atom/ion

ii. Ligand(s) and their types

iii. Coordination entity

iv. Oxidation number of the central metal ion

v. Coordination number

**Types of complexes:**

The coordination compounds can be classified into the following types based on (i) the net charge of the complex ion, (ii) kinds of ligands present in the coordination entity.

**Classification based on the net charge on the complex:**

A coordination compound in which the complex ion

i. carries a net positive charge is called a cationic complex. Examples: \[Ag(NH3)2\] +,

\[Co(NH3)6\] 3+ , \[Fe(H2O)6\]

2+, etc

ii. carries a net negative charge is called an anionic complex. Examples: \[Ag(CN)2\] -,

\[Co(CN)6\] 3- , \[Fe(CN)6\]

4-, etc

iii. bears no net charge, is called a neutral complex. Examples: \[Ni(CO)4\], \[Fe(CO)5\] , \[Co(NH3)3(Cl)3\],

**Classification based on kind of ligands:**

A coordination compound in which

i. the central metal ion/atom is coordinated to only one kind of ligands is called a homoleptic complex. Examples: \[Co(NH3)6\]

3+ , \[Fe(H2O)6\] 2+,

www.tntextbooks.in




  

136

ii. the central metal ion/atom is coordinated to more than one kind of ligands is called a heteroleptic complex. Example, \[Co(NH3)5Cl\]2+, \[Pt(NH3)2Cl2)\]

## Nomenclature of coordination compounds
 In the earlier days, the compounds were named after their discoverers. For example,

K\[PtCl3(C2H4)\] was called Zeise’s salt and \[Pt(NH3)4\]\[PtCl4\] is called Magnus’s green salt etc... There are numerous coordination compounds that have been synthesised and characterised. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has developed an elaborate system of nomenclature to name them systematically. The guidelines for naming coordination compounds based on IUPAC recommendations (2005) are as follows:

1\. The cation is named first, followed by the anion regardless of whether the ion is simple or complex. For example

• In K4\[Fe(CN)6\], the cation K+ is named first followed by\[Fe(CN)6\] 4-.

• In \[Co(NH3)6\]Cl3, the complex cation \[Co(NH3)6\] 3+ is named first followed by the

anion Cl-

• In \[Pt(NH3)4\]\[PtCl4\], the complex cation \[Pt(NH3)4\] 2+is named first followed by the

complex anion \[PtCl4\] 2-

2\. The simple ions are named as in other ionic compounds. For example,

**Simple cation Symbol Simple anion Symbol**

Sodium Na+ Chloride Cl-

Potassium K+ Nitrate NO3 -

Copper Cu2+ Sulphate SO4 2-

3\. To name a complex ion, the ligands are named first followed by the central metal atom/ion. When a complex ion contains more than one kind of ligands they are named in alphabetical order.

a. Naming the ligands:

i. The name of anionic ligands ends with the letter 'o' and the cationic ligand ends with 'ium'. The neutral ligands are usually called with their molecular names with fewer exceptions namely, H2O (aqua), CO (carbonyl), NH3 (ammine) and NO (nitrosyl).

ii. A κ-term is used to denote an ambidendate ligand in which more than one coordination mode is possible. For example, the ligand thiocyanate can bind to the central atom/ ion, through either the sulfur or the nitrogen atom. In this ligand, if sulphur forms a coordination bond with metal then the ligand is named thiocyanato-κS and if nitrogen is involved, then it is named thiocyanato-κN.

iii. If the coordination entity contains more than one ligand of a particular type, the multiples of ligand (2, 3, 4 etc...) is indicated by adding appropriate Greek prefixes (di, tri, tetra, etc...) to the name of the ligand. If the name of a ligand itself contains a Greek prefix (eg. ethylenediamine), use an alternate prefixes (bis, tris, tetrakis etc..) to specify the multiples of such ligands. These numerical prefixes are not taken into account for alphabetising the name of ligands.

**b. Naming the central metal**: In cationic/neutral complexes, the element name is used as such for naming the central metal atom/ion, whereas, a suffix 'ate' is used along with the element name in anionic complexes. The oxidation state of the metal is written immediately after the metal name using roman numerals in parenthesis.

## Isomerism in coordination compounds
 We have already learnt the concept of isomerism in the context of organic compounds,

in the previous year chemistry classes. Similarly, coordination compounds also exhibit isomerism. Isomerism is the phenomenon in which more than one coordination compounds having the same molecular formula have different physical and chemical properties due to different arrangement of ligands around the central metal atom. The following flow chart gives an overview of the common types of isomerism observed in coordination compounds,

arises due to the difference in the

arises due to different spatial orientation of ligands around the

metal ion

**Figure 5.2 Isomerism in coordination compounds**

### Structural isomers


The coordination compounds with same formula, but have different connections among their constituent atoms are called structural isomers or constitutional isomers. Four common types of structural isomers are discussed below.

**Linkage isomers:**

This type of isomers arises when an ambidentate ligand is bonded to the central metal atom/ion through either of its two different donor atoms. In the below mentioned examples, the nitrite ion is bound to the central metal ion Co3+ through a nitrogen atom in one complex,and through oxygen atom in other complex. **\[Co(NH3)5(NO2)\]2+**

**Figure 5.3 Linkage isomers**

**Coordination isomers:**

This type of isomers arises in the coordination compounds having both the cation and anion as complex ions. The interchange of one or more ligands between the cationic and the anionic coordination entities result in different isomers.

For example, in the coordination compound, \[Co(NH3)6\]\[Cr(CN)6\] the ligands ammonia and cyanide were bound respectively to cobalt and chromium while in its coordination isomer \[Cr(NH3)6\]\[Co(CN)6\] they are reversed.

**Some more examples for coordination isomers**

1\. \[Cr(NH3)5CN\]\[Co(NH3)(CN)5\] and \[Co(NH3)5CN\]\[Cr(NH3)(CN)5\]

2\. \[Pt(NH3)4\]\[Pd(Cl)4\] and \[Pd(NH3)4\]\[Pt(Cl)4\]

**Ionisation isomers:**

This type of isomers arises when an ionisable counter ion (simple ion) itself can act as a ligand. The exchange of such counter ions with one or more ligands in the coordination entity will result in ionisation isomers. These isomers will give different ions in solution. For example, consider the coordination compound \[Pt(en)2Cl2\]Br2. In this compound, both Br- and Cl- have the ability to act as a ligand and the exchange of these two ions result in a different isomer \[Pt(en)2Br2\]Cl2. In solution the first compound gives Br- ions while the later gives Cl- ions and hence these compounds are called ionisation isomers.

**Some more example for the isomers,**

1\. \[Cr(NH3)4ClBr\]NO2 and \[Cr(NH3)4Cl NO2\]Br

2\. \[Co(NH3)4Br2\]Cl and \[Co(NH3)4Cl Br\]Br

**Evaluate yourself 4:**

3\. A solution of \[Co(NH3)4l2\]Cl when treated with AgNO3 gives a white precipitate. What should be the formula of isomer of the dissolved complex that gives yellow precipitate with AgNO3. What are the above isomers called?

**Solvate isomers.**

The exchange of free solvent molecules such as water , ammonia, alcohol etc.. in the crystal lattice with a ligand in the coordination entity will give different isomers. These type of isomers are called solvate isomers. If the solvent molecule is water, then these isomers are called hydrate isomers. For example, the complex with chemical formula CrCl3.6H2O has three hydrate isomers as shown below.

\[Cr(H2O)6\]Cl3 a violet colour compound and gives three chloride ions in solution,

\[Cr(H2O)5Cl\]Cl2.H2O a pale green colour compound and gives two chloride ions in solution and,

\[Cr(H2O)4Cl2\]Cl.2H2O dark green colour compound and gives one chloride ion in solution

### Stereoisomers:


Similar to organic compounds, coordination compounds also exhibit stereoisomerism. The stereoisomers of a coordination compound have the same chemical formula and connectivity between the central metal atom and the ligands. But they differ in the spatial arrangement of ligands in three dimensional space. They can be further classified as geometrical isomers and optical isomers.

**Geometrical isomers:**

Geometrical isomerism exists in heteroleptic complexes due to different possible three dimensional spatial arrangements of the ligands around the central metal atom. This type of isomerism exists in square planer and octahedral complexes.

In square planar complexes of the form \[MA2B2\] n± and \[MA2BC\]n± (where A, B and C are

mono dentate ligands and M is the central metal ion/atom), Similar groups (A or B) present either on same side or on the opposite side of the central metal atom (M) give rise to two different geometrical isomers, and they are called, cis and trans isomers respectively.

The square planar complex of the type \[M(xy)2\] n± where xy is a bidentate ligand with two

different coordinating atoms also shows cis-trans isomerism. Square planar complex of the form \[MABCD\]n± also shows geometrical isomerism. In this case, by considering any one of the ligands (A, B, C or D) as a reference, the rest of the ligands can be arranged in three different ways leading to three geometrical isomers.

**Octahedral complexes:**

Octahedral complexes of the type \[MA2B4\] n±, \[M(xx)2B2\]

n± shows _cis-trans_ isomerism. Here A and B are monodentate ligands and xx is bidentate ligand with two same kind of donor atoms. In the octahedral complex, the position of ligands is indicated by the following numbering scheme.

Similarly, positions (1,6), (2,4), and (3,5) are identical and if similar ligands are present in these positions it is referred as a _trans-_isomer.

Octahedral complex of the type \[MA3B3\] n± also shows geometrical isomerism. If the three

similar ligands (A) are present in the corners of one triangular face of the octahedron and the other three ligands (B) are present in the opposing triangular face, then the isomer is referred as a facial isomer (_fac_ isomer)- Figure 5.6 (a).

If the three similar ligands are present around the meridian which is an imaginary semicircle from one apex of the octahedral to the opposite apex as shown in the fi gure 5.6(b), the isomer is called as a meridional isomer (mer isomer). Th is is called meridional because each set of ligands can be regarded as lying on a meridian of an octahedron.

As the number of different ligands increases, the number of possible isomers also increases. For the octahedral complex of the type \[MABCDEF\]n±, where A, B, C, D, E and F are monodentate ligands, fifteen different orientation are possible corresponding to 15 geometrical isomers. It is difficult to generate all the possible isomers.

### Optical Isomerism


Coordination compounds which possess chairality exhibit optical isomerism similar to organic compounds. The pair of two optically active isomers which are mirror images of each other are called enantiomers. Their solutions rotate the plane of the plane polarised light either clockwise or anticlockwise and the corresponding isomers are called 'd' (dextro rotatory) and 'l' (levo rotatory) forms respectively. The octahedral complexes of type \[M(xx)3\] n±, \[M(xx)2AB\]n± and \[M(xx)2B2\]

n± exhibit optical isomerism.

## Theories of coordination compound
 Alfred Werner considered the bonding in coordination compounds as the bonding

between a lewis acid and a lewis base. His approach is useful in explaining some of the observed properties of coordination compounds. However, properties such as colour, magnetic property etc.. of complexes could not be explained on the basis of his approach. Following werner theory, Linus pauling proposed the Valence Bond Theory (VBT) which assumes that the bond formed between the central metal atom and the ligand is purely covalent. Bethe and Van vleck treated the interaction between the metal ion and the ligands as electrostatic and extended the Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to explain the properties of coordination compounds. Further, Ligand field theory and Molecular orbital have been developed to explain the nature of bonding in the coordination compounds. In this porton we learn the elementry treatment of VBT and CFT to simple coordination compounds.

### Valence Bond Theory


According to this theory, the bond formed between the central metal atom and the ligand is due to the overlap of filled ligand orbitals containing a lone pair of electron with the vacant hybrid orbitals of the central metal atom.

**Main assumptions of VBT:**

1\. The ligand → metal bond in a coordination complex is covalent in nature. It is formed by sharing of electrons (provided by the ligands) between the central metal atom and the ligand.

2\. Each ligand should have at least one filled orbital containing a lone pair of electrons.

3\. In order to accommodate the electron pairs donated by the ligands, the central metal ion present in a complex provides required number (coordination number) of vacant orbitals.

4\. These vacant orbitals of central metal atom undergo hybridisation, the process of mixing of atomic orbitals of comparable energy to form equal number of new orbitals called hybridised orbitals with same energy.

5\. The vacant hybridised orbitals of the central metal ion, linearly overlap with filled orbitals of the ligands to form coordinate covalent sigma bonds between the metal and the ligand.

6\. The hybridised orbitals are directional and their orientation in space gives a definite geometry to the complex ion.

7\. In the octahedral complexes, if the (n-1) d orbitals are involved in hybridisation, then they are called inner orbital complexes or low spin complexes or spin paired complexes. If the nd orbitals are involved in hybridisation, then such complexes are called outer orbital or high spin or spin free complexes. Here n represents the principal quantum number of the outermost shell.

8\. The complexes containing a central metal atom with unpaired electron(s) are paramagnetic. If all the electrons are paired, then the complexes will be diamagnetic.

9\. Ligands such as CO, CN-, en, and NH3 present in the complexes cause pairing of electrons present in the central metal atom. Such ligands are called strong field ligands.

10\. Greater the overlapping between the ligand orbitals and the hybridised metal orbital, greater is the bond strength.

Let us illustrate the VBT by considering the following examples.

1\. It does not explain the colour of the complex

2\. It considers only the spin only magnetic moments and does not consider the other components of magnetic moments.

### Crystal Field Theory


Valence bond theory helps us to visualise the bonding in complexes. However, it has limitations as mentioned above.Hence Crystal Field Theory to expalin some of the properties like colour, magnetic behavior etc.,This theory was originally used to explain the nature of bonding in ionic crystals. Later on, it is used to explain the properties of transition metals and their complexes. The salient features of this theory are as follows.

1\. Crystal Field Theory (CFT) assumes that the bond between the ligand and the central metal atom is purely ionic. i.e. the bond is formed due to the electrostatic attraction between the electron rich ligand and the electron deficient metal.

2\. In the coordination compounds, the central metal atom/ion and the ligands are considered as point charges (in case of charged metal ions or ligands) or electric dipoles (in case of metal atoms or neutral ligands).

3\. According to crystal field theory, the complex formation is considered as the following series of hypothetical steps.

**Step 1: In an isolated gaseous state, all the five d orbitals of the central metal ion are degenerate.** Initially, the ligands form a spherical field of negative charge around the metal. In this field, the energies of all the five d orbitals will increase due to the repulsion between the electrons of the metal and the ligand.

**Step 2: The ligands** are approaching the metal atom in actual bond directions. To illustrate this let us consider an octahedral field, in which the central metal ion is located at the origin and the six ligands are coming from the +x, -x, +y, -y, +z and -z directions as shown below.

As shown in the figure, the orbitals lying along the axes dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals will experience strong repulsion and raise in energy to a greater extent than the orbitals with lobes directed between the axes (dxy, dyz and dzx). Thus the degenerate d orbitals now split into two sets and the process is called crystal field splitting.

Step 3: Up to this point the complex formation would not be favoured. However, when the ligands approach further, there will be an attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged metal ion, that results in a net decrease in energy. This decrease in energy is the driving force for the complex formation. **Crystal field splitting in octahedral complexes:**

During crystal field splitting in octahedral field, in order to maintain the average energy of the orbitals (barycentre) constant, the energy of the orbitals dx2-y2 and dz2 (represented as eg orbitals) will increase by 3/5Δo while that of the other three orbitals dxy, dyz and dzx (represented as t2g orbitals) decrease by 2/5Δo. Here, Δo represents the crystal field splitting energy in the octahedral field.

**Figure: 5.10 - Crystal field splitting in octahedral field**

**Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral complexes:**

The approach of ligands in tetrahedral field can be visualised as follows. Consider a cube in which the central metal atom is placed at its centre (i.e. origin of the coordinate axis as shown in the figure). The four ligands approach the central metal atom along the direction of the leading diagonals drawn from alternate corners of the cube.

In this field, none of the d orbitals point dirctly towards the ligands,however the t2 orbitals (dxy, dyz and dzx) are pointing close to the direction in which ligands are approaching than the e orbitals (dx2-y2 and dz2).

As a result, the energy of t2 orbitals increases by 2/5Δt and that of e orbitals decreases by 3/5Δt as shown below. when compared to the octahedral field, this splitting is inverted and the spliting energy is less. The relation between the crystal field splitting energy in octahedral and tetrahedral ligand field is given by the expression;

**Crystal filed splitting Energy and nature of ligands:**

The magnitude of crystal field splitting energy not only depends on the ligand field as discussed above but also depends on the nature of the ligand, the nature of the central metal atom/ion and the charge on it. Let us understand the effect of the nature of ligand on crystal field splitting by calculating the crystal field splitting energy of the octahedral complexes of titanium(III) with different ligands such as fluoride, bromide and water

From the above calculations, it is clear that the crystal filed splitting energy of the Ti3+ in complexes,the three ligands is in the order; Br- < F- < H2O. Similarly, it has been found form the spectral data that the crystal field splitting power of various ligands for a given metal ion, are in the following order

I-<Br-<SCN-<Cl-<S2-<F-<OH-≈urea< ox2-< H2O< NCS-<EDTA4-<NH3<en<NO2 -<CN- < CO

The above series is known as spectrochemical series. The ligands present on the right side of the series such as carbonyl causes relatively larger crystal field splitting and are called strong ligands or strong field ligands, while the ligands on the left side are called weak field ligands and causes relatively smaller crystal field splitting.

**Distribution of d electrons in octahedral complexes:**

The filling of electrons in the d orbitals in the presence of ligand field also follows Hund's rule. In the octahedral complexes with d2 and d3 configurations, the electrons occupy different degenerate t2g orbitals and remains unpaired. In case of d4 configuration, there are two possibilities. The fourth electron may either go to the higher energy eg orbitals or it may pair with one of the t2g electrons. In this scenario, the preferred configuration will be the one with lowest energy.

If the octahedral crystal field splitting energy (Δo) is greater than the pairing energy (P), it is necessary to cause pairing of electrons in an orbital, then the fourth electron will pair up with an the electron in the t2g orbital. Conversely, if the Δo is lesser than P, then the fourth electron will occupy one of the degenerate higher energy eg orbitals.

For example, let us consider two different iron(III) complexes \[Fe(H2O)6\] 3+ (weak field

complex; wave number corresponds to Δo is 14000 cm-1) and \[Fe(CN)6\] 3- (Strong field complex;

wave number corresponds to Δo is 35000 cm-1). The wave number corresponds to the pairing energy of Fe3+ is 30000 cm-1. In both these complexes the Fe3+ has d5 configuration. In aqua complex, the Δo < P hence, the fourth & fifth electrons enter eg orbitals and the configuration is t2g

3, eg 2. In the cyanido complex Δo > P and hence the fourth & fifth electrons pair up with the

electrons in the t2g orbitals and the electronic configuration is t2g 5, eg

0.

The actual distribution of electrons can be ascertained by calculating the crystal field stabilisation energy (CFSE). The crystal field stabilisation energy is defined as the energy difference of electronic configurations in the ligand field (ELF) and the isotropic field/barycentre (Eiso).

CFSE (ΔEo) = {ELF } - {Eiso }

\= {\[nt2g (-0.4)+neg

(0.6)\] Δo + npP} - {n'p P}

Here, nt2g is the number of electrons in t2g orbitals; neg is number of electrons in eg orbitals; np is number of electron pairs in the ligand field; & n'p is the number of electron pairs in the isotropic field (barycentre).

**Colour of the complex and crystal field splitting energy:**

Most of the transition metal complexes are coloured. A substance exhibits colour when it absorbs the light of a particular wavelength in the visible region and transmit the rest of the visible light. When this transmitted light enters our eye, our brain recognises its colour. The colour of the transmitted light is given by the complementary colour of the absorbed light. For example, the hydrated copper(II) ion is blue in colour as it absorbs orange light, and transmit its complementary colour, blue. A list of absorbed wavelength and their complementary colour is given in the following table.

The observed colour of a coordination compound can be explained using crystal field theory. We learnt that the ligand field causes the splitting of d orbitals of the central metal atom into two sets (t2g and eg). When the white light falls on the complex ion, the central metal ion absorbs visible light corresponding to the crystal filed splitting energy and transmits rest of the light which is responsible for the colour of the complex.

This absorption causes excitation of d-electrons of central metal ion from the lower energy t2g level to the higher energy eg level which is known as d-d transition.

Let us understand the d-d transitions by considering \[Ti(H2O)6\]

3+ as an example. In this complex the central metal ion is Ti3+, which has d1 configuration. This single electron occupies one of the t2g orbitals in the octahedral aqua ligand field. When white light falls on this complex the d electron absorbs light and promotes itself to eg level. The spectral data show the absorption maximum is at 20000 cm-1 corresponding to the crystal field splitting energy (Δo) 239.7 kJ mol-1. The transmitted colour associated with this absorption is purple and hence ,the complex appears purple in colour.

The octahedral titanium(III) complexes with other ligands such as bromide and fluoride have different colours. This is due to the difference in the magnitude of crystal field splitting by these ligands (Refer page 156). However, the complexes of central metal atom such as of Sc3+, Ti4+, Cu+, Zn2+, etc... are colourless. This is because the d-d transition is not possible in complexes with central metal having d0 or d10 configuration.

**Evaluate yourself 8:**

11\. The mean pairing energy and octahedral field splitting energy of \[Mn(CN)6\] 3- are

28,800 cm-1 and 38500 cm-1 respectively. Whether this complex is stable in low spin or high spin?

12\. Draw energy level diagram and indicate the number of electrons in each level for the complex \[Cu(H2O)6\]

2+. Whether the complex is paramagnetic or diamagnetic?

13\. For the \[CoF6\] 3- ion the mean pairing energy is found to be 21000 cm-1 . The magnitude

of Δ0 is 13000cm-1. Calculate the crystal field stabilization energy for this complex ion corresponding to low spin and high spin states.

**Metallic carbonyls**

Metal carbonyls are the transition metal complexes of carbon monoxide, containing Metal- Carbon bond. In these complexes CO molecule acts as a neutral ligand. The first homoleptic carbonyl Ni CO

4( )  nickel tetra carbonyl was reported by Mond in 1890.These metallic carbonyls are widely studied because of their industrial importance, catalytic properties and their ability to release carbon monoxide.

**Classification:**

Generally metal carbonyls are classified in two different ways as described below.

**(i)** **Classification based on the number of metal atoms present.**

Depending upon the number of metal atoms present in a given metallic carbonyl, they are classified as follows.

**a.** **Mononuclear carbonyls**

These compounds contain only one metal atom, and have comparatively simple structures.

For example, Ni CO 4( )  - nickel tetracarbonyl is tetrahedral, Fe CO

5( )  - Iron pentacarbonyl

is trigonalbipyramidal, and Cr CO 6( )  - Chromium hexacarbonyl is octahedral.

**b.** **Poly nuclear carbonyls**

Metallic carbonyls containing two or more metal atoms are called poly nuclear carbonyls. Poly

nuclear metal carbonyls may be Homonuclear Co CO Mn CO Fe CO2 8 10 3 12( )  ( )  ( ) ( ), ,2

or hetero nuclear MnCo CO MnRe CO 9 10( )  ( ) ( ), etc.

**(ii)** **Classification based on the structure:**

The structures of the binuclear metal carbonyls involve either metal–metal bonds or bridging CO groups, or both. The carbonyl ligands that are attached to only one metal atom are referred to as **terminal** carbonyl groups, whereas those attached to two metal atoms simultaneously are called _bridging_ carbonyls. Depending upon the structures, metal carbonyls are classified as follows.

**a.** **Non-bridged metal carbonyls:**

These metal carbonyls do not contain any bridging carbonyl ligands. They may be of two types.

(i) Non- bridged metal carbonyls which contain only terminal carbonyls. Examples:

**Bonding in metal carbonyls**

In metal carbonyls, the bond between metal atom and the carbonyl ligand consists of two components. The first component is an electron pair donation from the carbon atom of carbonyl ligand into a vacant d-orbital of central metal atom. This electron pair donation forms M CO bondσ←  sigma bond. This sigma bond formation increases the electron density in metal d orbitals and makes the metal electron rich. In order to compensate for this increased electron density, a filled metal d-orbital interacts with the empty π\* orbital on the carbonyl ligand and transfers the added electron density back to the ligand. This second component

is called π-back bonding . Thus in metal carbonyls, electron density moves from ligand to metal through sigma bonding and from metal to ligand through pi bonding, this synergic effect accounts for strong M CO← bond in metal carbonyls. This phenomenon is shown diagrammatically as follows.

## Stability of metal complexes:
 The stability of coordination complexes can be interpreted in two different ways. The first

one is thermodynamic stability and second one is kinetic stability. Thermodynamic stability of a coordination complex refers to the free energy change (∆G) of a complex formation reaction. Kinetic stability of a coordination complex refers to the ligand substitution. In some cases, complexes can undergo rapid ligand substitution; such complexes are called labile complexes. However, some complexes undergo ligand substitution very slowly (or sometimes no substitution), such complexes are called inert complexes.

**Stability constant:(**β**)**

The stability of a coordination complex is a measure of its resistance to the replacement of one ligand by another. The stability of a complex refers to the degree of association between two species involved in an equilibrium. Let us consider the following complex formation reaction

Cu NH Cu NH2+ 3

\+ ( )  +

β = ( ) 

\+ Cu NH

\---------( 1 )

So, as the concentration of Cu NH3 4

2( )  +

increases the value of stability complexes also

increases. Therefore the greater the value of stability constant greater is the stability of the

complex.

Generally coordination complexes are stable in their solutions; however, the complex ion can undergo dissociation to a small extent. Extent of dissociation depends on the strength of the metal ligand bond, thus Stronger the M L← , lesser is the dissociation.

In aqueous solutions, when complex ion dissociates, there will be equilibrium between undissociated complex ion and dissociated ions. Hence the stability of the metal complex can be expressed in terms of dissociation equilibrium constant or instability constant α( ) . For example let us consider the dissociation of Cu NH3 4

in aqueous solution.

From (1) and (2) we can say that, the reciprocal of dissociation equilibrium constant α( ) is called as formation equilibrium constant or stability constant β( ) .

**Significance of stability constants**

The stability of coordination complex is measured in terms of its stability constant β( ) . Higher the value of stability constant for a complex ion, greater is the stability of the complex ion. Stability constant values of some important complexes are listed in table

### Stepwise formation constants and overall formation constants


When a free metal ion is in aqueous medium, it is surrounded by (coordinated with) water molecules. It is represented as \[MS6\]. If ligands which are stronger than water are added to this metal salt solution, coordinated water molecules are replaced by strong ligands.

Let us consider the formation of a metal complex ML6 in aqueous medium.(Charge on the metal ion is ignored) complex formation may occur in single step or step by step. If ligands added to the metal ion in single step, then

## Importance and applications of coordination complexes:
 The coordination complexes are of great importance. These compounds are present in

many plants, animals and in minerals. Some Important applications of coordination complexes are described below.

1\. Phthalo blue – a bright blue pigment is a complex of Copper (II) ion and it is used in printing ink and in the packaging industry.

2\. Purification of Nickel by Mond’s process involves formation \[Ni(CO)4\], which Yields 99.5% pure Nickel on decomposition.

3\. EDTA is used as a chelating ligand for the separation of lanthanides,in softening of hard water and also in removing lead poisoning.

4\. Coordination complexes are used in the extraction of silver and gold from their ores by forming soluble cyano complex. These cyano complexes are reduced by zinc to yield metals. This process is called as Mac-Arthur –Forrest cyanide process.

5\. Some metal ions are estimated more accurately by complex formation. For example, Ni2+ ions present in Nickel chloride solution is estimated accurately for forming an insoluble complex called \[Ni(DMG)2\].

6\. Many of the complexes are used as catalysts in organic and inorganic reactions. For example,

(i) Wilkinson’s catalyst - PPh RhCl3 3( )  is used for hydrogenation of alkenes.

(ii) Ziegler-Natta catalyst - TiCl + Al C H4 2 5 3\[ \] ( ) is used in the polymerization of ethene.

7\. In order to get a fine and uniform deposit of superior metals (Ag, Au, Pt etc.,) over

base metals, Coordination complexes Ag CN and Au CN( )  ( )  − −

2 2 etc., are used in

electrolytic bath.

8\. Many complexes are used as medicines for the treatment of various diseases. For example,

(1) Ca-EDTA chelate, is used in the treatment of lead and radioactive poisoning. That is for removing lead and radioactive metal ions from the body.

(2) Cis-platin is used as an antitumor drug in cancer treatment.

9\. In photography, when the developed film is washed with sodium thio sulphatesolution (hypo), the negative film gets fixed. Undecomposed AgBr forms a soluble complex called sodiumdithiosulphatoargentate(I) which can be easily removed by washing the film with water.

10\. **Many biological systems contain metal complexes. For example,**

(i) A red blood corpuscles (RBC) is composed of heme group, which is Fe2+- Porphyrin complex.it plays an important role in carrying oxygen from lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs.

(ii) Chlorophyll, a green pigment present in green plants and algae, is a coordination complex containing Mg2+ as central metal ion surrounded by a modifi ed Porphyrin ligand called corrin ring. It plays an important role in photosynthesis, by which plants converts CO2 and water into carbohydrates and oxygen.

(iii) Vitamin B12(cyanocobalamine) is the only vitamin consist of metal ion. it is a coordination complex in which the central metal ion is Co+ surrounded by Porphyrin like ligand.

(iv) Many enzymes are known to be metal complexes, they regulate biological processes. For example, Carboxypeptidase is a protease enzyme that hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion, contains a zinc ion coordinated to the protein.

**Cisplatin:**

Cisplatin is a square planar coordination complex (cis- \[Pt (NH3)2Cl2\]), in which two similar ligands are in adjacent positions.

It is a Platinum-based anticancer drugTh is drug undergoes hydrolysis and reacts with DNA to produce various crosslinks. Th ese crosslinks hinder the DNA replication and transcription, which results in cell growth inhibition and ultimately cell death.

It also crosslinks with cellular proteins and inhibits mitosis.

„ When two or more stable compounds in solution are mixed together and allowed to evaporate, in certain cases there is a possibility for the formation of double salts or coordination compounds. The double salts loose their identity and dissociates into their constituent simple ions in solutions , whereas the complex ion in coordination compound, does not loose its identity and never dissociate to give simple ions.

„ According to werner, most of the elements exhibit, two types of valence namely primary valence and secondary valence and each element tend to satisfy both the valences.In modern terminology, the primary valence is referred as the oxidation state of the metal atom and the secondary valence as the coordination number.

„ Coordination entity is an ion or a neutral molecule, composed of a central atom, usually a metal and the array of other atoms or groups of atoms (ligands) that are attached to it.

**Summary**

168

„ The central atom/ion is the one that occupies the central position in a coordination entity and binds other atoms or groups of atoms (ligands) to itself, through a coordinate covalent bond.

„ The ligands are the atoms or groups of atoms bound to the central atom/ion. The atom in a ligand that is bound directly to the central metal atom is known as a donor atom.

„ The complex ion of the coordination compound containing the central metal atom/ion and the ligands attached to it, is collectively called coordination sphere and are usually enclosed in square brackets with the net charge.

„ The three dimensional spacial arrangement of ligand atoms/ions that are directly attached to the central atom is known as the coordination polyhedron (or polygon).

„ The number of ligand donor atoms bonded to a central metal ion in a complex is called the coordination number of the metal.

„ The oxidation state of a central atom in a coordination entity is defined as the charge it would bear if all the ligands were removed along with the electron pairs that were shared with the central atom.

„ This type of isomers arises when an ambidentate ligand is bonded to the central metal atom/ion through either of its two different donor atoms.

„ This type of isomers arises in the coordination compounds having both the cation and anion as complex ions. The interchange of one or more ligands between the cationic and the anionic coordination entities result in different isomers.

„ **Ionisation isomers** arises when an ionisable counter ion (simple ion) itself can act as a ligand. The exchange of such counter ions with one or more ligands in the coordination entity will result in ionisation isomers.

„ Geometrical isomerism exists in heteroleptic complexes due to different possible three dimensional spatial arrangements of the ligands around the central metal atom. This type of isomerism exists in square planer and octahedral complexes.

„ Coordination compounds which possess chairality exhibit optical isomerism similar to organic compounds. The pair of two optically active isomers which are mirror images of each other are called enantiomers.

„ Linus pauling proposed the Valence Bond Theory (VBT) which assumes that the bond formed between the central metal atom and the ligand is purely covalent. Bethe and Van vleck treated the interaction between the metal ion and the ligands as electrostatic and extended the Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to explain the properties of coordination compounds.

**CRYSTAL FIELD THEORY**

**Steps** • Open the browser and type the URL given (or) Scan the QR Code. You will see the webpage as

shown in the fi gure.

**Note:** _One time sign up is needed to access this webpage. Login using your username and password. Once logged in click the simulation tab._

• You can select a suitable ligand fi eld splitting using the drop down menu (box 1). Select a metal of interest and a ligand using the drop down menu (box 2). Now crystal fi eld splitting for the selected complex appears on the screen.

• Apply crystal fi eld theory to the selected complex and fi ll the d-electrons in the t2g and eg orbitals by clicking each orbital. Click on the orbitals thrice to remove electrons. Aft er completion, click submit button (box 4). Now you can check the correctness of the electron distribution. If wrong try again.

• Enter the number of electrons in the t2g & eg orbitlals in the work sheet at the bottom of the page (box 6), Th e calculated Crystal Field Stabilisation Energy (CFSE) will be displayed.

By using this tool you can understand the crystal fi eld splitting of diff erent metal ions in octahedral and tetrahedral ligand fi eld and also calculate the Crystal Field Stabilisation Energy (CFSE) of a complex using crystal fi eld theory.
