 When two or more stable compounds in solution are mixed together and allowed to evaporate, in certain cases there is a possibility for the formation of double salts or coordination compounds. For example when an equimolar solution of ferrous sulphate and ammonium sulphate are mixed and allowed to crystallise, a double salt namely Mohr's salt (Ferrous ammonium sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>.(NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O) is formed. Let us recall the blood red colour formation in the inorganic qualitative analysis of ferric ion, the reaction between ferric chloride and potassium thiocyanate solution gives a blood red coloured coordination compound, potassium ferrithiocyanate K<sub>3</sub>\[Fe(SCN)<sub>6</sub>\]. If we perform a qualitative analysis to identify the constituent ions present in both the compounds, Mohr's salt answers the presence of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ,NH<sup>4+</sup>and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>ions, whereas the potassium ferrithiocyanate will not answer Fe<sup>2+</sup> and SCN<sup>-</sup>ions. From this we can infer that the double salts lose their identity and dissociates into their constituent simple ions in solutions , whereas the complex ion in coordination compound, does not loose its identity and never dissociate to give simple ions.
