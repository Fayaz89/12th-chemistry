**Sir William Ramsay, (1852 – 1916)**

Sir William Ramsay was a Scottish chemist who discovered the noble gases. During the years 1885–1890 he published several important papers on the oxides of nitrogen.In August 1894, Ramsay had isolated a new heavy element of air, and he named it "argon", (the Greek word meaning "lazy").In the following years, he worked with Morris Travers and discovered neon, krypton, and xenon. In 1910 he isolated and characterized radon. In recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gases, he was awarded a noble prize in chemistry in 1904. His work in isolating noble gases led to the development of a new section of the periodic table.

**INTRODUCTION**

We have already learnt the general characteristics of p-block elements and the first two group namely icosagens (boron group) and tetragens (carbon group) in the previous unit. In this unit we learn the remaining p-block groups, pnictogens, chalcogens, halogens and inert gases.

## Group 15 (Nitrogen group) elements: 3.1.1 Occurrence:


About 78 % of earth atmosphere contains dinitorgen (N2) gas. It is also present in earth crust as sodium nitrate (Chile saltpetre) and potassium nitrate (Indian saltpetre). The 11th most abundant element phosphorus, exists as phosphate (fluroapatite, chloroapatite and hydroxyapatite). The other elements arsenic, antimony and bismuth are present as sulphides and are not very abundant.

### Physical properties:

It can also be obtained by oxidising ammonia using bromine water

8NH3 + 3Br2 6NH4Br + N2

**Properties**

Nitrogen gas is rather inert. Terrestrial nitrogen contains 14.5% and 0.4% of nitrogen-14 and nitrogen-15 respectively. The later is used for isotopic labelling. The chemically inert character of nitrogen is largely due to high bonding energy of the molecules 225 cal mol-1 (946 kJ mol-1). Interestingly the triply bonded species is notable for its less reactivity in comparison with other iso-electronic triply bonded systems such as -C≡C-, C≡O, X-C≡N, X-N≡C, -C≡C-, and -C≡N. These groups can act as donor where as dinitrogen cannot. However, it can form complexes with metal (M← N≡N) like CO to a less extent

The only reaction of nitrogen at room temperature is with lithium forming Li3N. With other elements, nitrogen combines only at elevated temperatures. Group 2 metals and Th forms ionic nitrides.

Direct reaction with hydrogen gives ammonia. This reaction is favoured by high pressures and at optimum temperature in presence of iron catalyst. This reaction is the basis of Haber’s process for the synthesis of ammonia.

**Uses of nitrogen**

1\. Nitrogen is used for the manufacture of ammonia, nitric acid and calcium cyanamide etc.

2\. Liquid nitrogen is used for producing low temperature required in cryosurgery, and so in biological preservation .

### Ammonia (NH3)


**Preparation:**

Ammonia is formed by the hydrolysis of urea. NH2CONH2 +H2O 2NH3 +CO2

Ammonia is prepared in the laboratory by heating an ammonium salt with a base.

It can also be prepared by heating a metal nitrides such as magnesium nitride with water. Mg N 6H O 3Mg(OH) + 2NH

It is industrially manufactured by passing nitrogen and hydrogen over iron catalyst (a small amount of K2O and Al2O3 is also used to increase the rate of attainment of equilibrium) at 750 K at 200 atm pressure. In the actual process the hydrogen required is obtained from water gas and nitrogen from fractional distillation of liquid air.

**Properties**

Ammonia is a pungent smelling gas and is lighter than air. It can readily liquefied by at about 9 atmospheric pressure. The liquid boils at -38.4°C and freezes at -77° C. Liquid ammonia resembles water in its physical properties. i.e. it is highly associated through strong hydrogen bonding. Ammonia is extremely soluble in water (702 Volume in 1 Volume of water) at 20°C and 760mm pressure.

At low temperatures two soluble hydrate NH3.H2O and 2NH3.H2O are isolated. In these molecules ammonia and water are linked by hydrogen bonds. In aqueous solutions also ammonia may be hydrated in a similar manner and we call the same as (NH3.H2O)

**Formation of amines:** Ammonia forms ammonated compounds by ion dipole attraction. Eg. \[CaCl2.8NH3\]. In this, the negative ends of ammonia dipole is attracted to Ca2+ ion.

It can also act as a ligand and form coordination compounds such as \[Co(NH3)6\] 3+, \[Ag(NH3)2\]

For example when excess ammonia is added to aqueous solution copper sulphate a deep blue colour compound \[Cu(NH3)4\]

2+ is formed.

**Structure of ammonia**

Ammonia molecule is pyramidal in shape N-H bond distance is 1.016 Å and H-H bond distance is 1.645 Å with a bond angle 107°. The structure of ammonia may be regarded as a tetrahedral with

### Nitric acid


**Preparation**

Nitric acid is prepared by heating equal amounts of potassium or sodium nitrate with concentrated sulphuric acid.

KNO + H SO KHSO + HNO 3 2 4

4 3  →

The temperature is kept as low as possible to avoid decomposition of nitric acid. The acid condenses to a fuming liquid which is coloured brown by the presence of a little nitrogen dioxide which is formed due to the decomposition of nitric acid.

4HNO 4NO + 2H O + O 3

2 2 2  →

**Commercial method of preparation**

Nitric acid prepared in large scales using Ostwald's process. In this method ammonia from Haber’s process is mixed about 10 times of air. This mixture is preheated and passed into the catalyst chamber where they come in contact with platinum gauze. The temperature rises to about 1275 K and the metallic gauze brings about the rapid catalytic oxidation of ammonia resulting in the formation of NO, which then oxidised to nitrogen dioxide.

4NH + 5O 4NO + 6H O + 120 kJ 3 2

2NO + O 2NO 2

The nitrogen dioxide produced is passed through a series of adsorption towers. It reacts with water to give nitric acid. Nitric oxide formed is bleached by blowing air.

3NO + H O 2HNO + NO2 2

3 →

**Properties**

Pure nitric acid is colourless. It boils at 86 °C. The acid is completely miscible with water forming a constant boiling mixture (98% HNO3, Boiling point 120.5 °C). Fuming nitric acid contains oxides of nitrogen. It decomposes on exposure to sunlight or on being heated, into nitrogen dioxide, water and oxygen.

4HNO 4NO + 2H O + O 3

2 2 2  →

Due to this reaction pure acid or its concentrated solution becomes yellow on standing.

In most of the reactions, nitric acid acts as an oxidising agent. Hence the oxidation state changes from +5 to a lower one. It doesn’t yield hydrogen in its reaction with metals. Nitric acid can act as an acid, an oxidizing agent and an nitrating agent.

**As an acid:** Like other acids it reacts with bases and basic oxides to form salts and water

**Action of nitric acid on metals**

All metals with the exception of gold, platinum, rhodium, iridium and tantalum reacts with nitric acid. Nitric acid oxidises the metals. Some metals such as aluminium, iron, cobalt, nickel and chromium are rendered passive in concentrated acid due to the formation of a layer of their oxides on the metal surface, which prevents the nitric acid from reacting with pure metal.

With weak electropositive metals like tin, arsenic, antimony, tungsten and molybdenum, nitric acid gives metal oxides in which the metal is in the higher oxidation state and the acid is reduced to a lower oxidation state. The most common products evolved when nitric acid reacts with a metal are gases NO2, NO and H2O. Occasionally N2, NH2OH and NH3 are also formed.

### Allotropic forms of phosphorus:
 Phosphorus has several allotropic modification

of which the three forms namely white, red and black phosphorus are most common.

The freshly prepared white phosphorus is colourless but becomes pale yellow due to formation of a layer of red phosphorus upon standing. Hence it is also known as yellow phosphorus. It is poisonous in nature and has a characteristic garlic smell. It glows in the dark due to oxidation which is called phosphorescence. Its ignition temperature is very low and hence it undergoes spontaneous combustion in air at room temperature to give P2O5.

The white phosphorus can be changed into red phosphorus by heating it to 420 ⁰C in the absence of air and light. Unlike white phosphorus it is not poisonous and does not show Phosphorescence. It also does not ignite at low temperatures. The red phosphorus can be converted back into white phosphorus by boiling it in an inert atmosphere and condensing the vapour under water.

The phosphorus has a layer structure and also acts as a semiconductor. The four atoms in phosphorus have polymeric structure with chains of P4 linked tetrahedrally. Unlike nitrogen P≡P is less stable than P-P single bonds. Hence, phosphorus atoms are linked through single bonds rather than triple bonds. In addition to the above two more allotropes namely scarlet and violet phosphorus are also known for phosphorus.

### Properties of phosphorus


Phosphorus is highly reactive and has the following important chemical properties

**Reaction with oxygen: Yellow phosphorus readily catches fire in air giving dense white** fumes of phosphorus pentoxide. Red phosphorus also reacts with oxygen on heating to give phosphorus trioxide or phosphorus pentoxide.

**Structure:**

In phosphine, phosphorus shows sp3 hybridisation. Three orbitals are occupied by bond pair and fourth corner is occupied by lone pair of electrons. Hence, bond angle is reduced to 93.5°. Phosphine has a pyramidal shape.

**Uses of phosphine:**

Phosphine is used for producing smoke screen as it gives large smoke. In a ship, a pierced container with a mixture of calcium carbide and calcium phosphide, liberates phosphine and acetylene when thrown into sea. The liberated phosphine catches fire and ignites acetylene. These burning gases serves as a signal to the approaching ships. This is known as Holmes signal.

### Phosphorous trichloride and pentachloride:

**Preparation:**

When a slow stream of chlorine is passed over white phosphorus, phosphorous trichloride is formed. It can also be obtained by treating white phosphorus with thionyl chloride.

pm which is shorter than the single bond distance of P-O (184 pm) due to pπ-dπ bonding and results in considerable double bond character.

In P4O10 each P atoms form three bonds to oxygen atom and also an additional coordinate bond with an oxygen atom.

Terminal P-O bond length is 143 pm, which is less than the expected single bond distance. This may be due to lateral overlap of filled p orbitals of an oxygen atom with empty d orbital on phosphorous.

**Group 16 (Oxygen group) elements:**

**Occurrence:**

Elements belonging group 16 are called chalgogens or ore forming elements as most of the ores are oxides or sulphides. First element oxygen, the most abundant element, exists in both as dioxygen in air (above 20 % by weight as well as volume) and in combined form as oxides. Oxygen and sulphur makes up about 46.6 % & 0.034 & of earth crust by weight respectively. Sulphur exists as sulphates (gypsum, epsom etc...) and sulphide (galena, Zinc blende etc...). It is also present in the volcanic ashes. The other elements of this groups are scarce and are often found as selenides, tellurides etc... along with sulphide ores.

## Oxygen:


**Preparation: The atmosphere and water contain 23% and 83% by mass of oxygen respectively.** Most of the world’s rock contain combined oxygen. Industrially oxygen is obtained by fractional distillation of liquefied air. In the laboratory, oxygen is prepared by one of the following methods.

**Properties**

Under ordinary condition oxygen exists as a diatomic gas. Oxygen is paramagnetic. Like nitrogen and fluorine, oxygen form strong hydrogen bonds. Oxygen exists in two allotropic forms namely dioxygen (O2) and ozone or trioxygen (O3). Although negligible amounts of ozone occurs at sea level it is formed in the upper atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet light. In the laboratory ozone is prepared by passing electrical discharge through oxygen. At a potential of 20,000 V about 10% of oxygen is converted into ozone it gives a mixture known as ozonised oxygen. Pure ozone is obtained as a pale blue gas by the fractional distillation of liquefied ozonised oxygen.

**Chemical properties:**

The chemical properties of oxygen and ozone differ vastly. Oxygen combines with many metals and non-metals to form oxides. With some elements such as s-block elements combination of oxygen occurs at room temperature. Some of less reactive metals react when powdered finely and made to react exothermically with oxygen at room temperature but a lump of metal is unaffected under same condition. These finely divided metals are known as pyrophoric and when set the powder on fire, heat is liberated during a reaction.

On the other hand ozone is a powerful oxidising agent and it reacts with many substances under conditions where oxygen will not react. For example, it oxidises potassium iodide to iodine. This reaction is quantitative and can be used for estimation of ozone.

O + 2KI + H O 2KOH + O I 3 2

Ozone is commonly used for oxidation of organic compounds. In acidic solution ozone exceeds the oxidising power of fluorine and atomic oxygen. The rate of decomposition of ozone drops sharply in alkaline solution.

**Uses:**

1\. Oxygen is one of the essential component for the survival of living organisms.

2\. It is used in welding (oxyacetylene welding)

3\. Liquid oxygen is used as fuel in rockets etc...

### Allotrophic forms of sulphur


Sulphur exists in crystalline as well as amorphous allotrophic forms. The crystalline form includes rhombic sulphur (α sulphur) and monoclinic sulphur (β sulphur). Amorphous allotropic form includes plastic sulphur (γ sulphur), milk of sulphur and colloidal sulphur.

**Rhombic sulphur** also known as α sulphur, is the only thermodynamically stable allotropic form at ordinary temperature and pressure. The crystals have a characteristic yellow colour and composed of S8 molecules. When heated slowly above 96 ⁰C, it converts into monoclinic sulphur. Upon cooling below 96 ⁰C the β form converts back to α form. **Monoclinic sulphur** also contains S8 molecules in addition to small amount of S6 molecules. It exists as a long needle like prism and is also called as prismatic sulphur. It is stable between 96 ⁰C - 119 ⁰C and slowly changes into rhombic sulphur.

When molten sulphur is poured into cold water a yellow rubbery ribbon of plastic sulphur is produced. They are very soft and can be stretched easily. On standing (cooling slowly) it slowly becomes hard and changes to stable rhombic sulphur.

Sulphur also exists in liquid and gaseous states. At around 140 ⁰C the monoclinic sulphur melts to form mobile pale yellow liquid called λ sulphur. The vapour over the liquid sulphur consists of 90 % of S8, S7 & S6 and small amount of mixture of S2, S3, S4, S5 molecules.

2\. It can be used for disinfecting crops and plants in agriculture.

**Structure of sulphur dioxide:**

In sulphur dioxide, sulphur atom undergoes sp2 hybridisation. A double bond arises between S and O is due to pπ- dπ overlapping.

### Sulphuric acid: (H2SO4)


**Preparation:**

Sulphuric acid can be manufactured by lead chamber process, cascade process or contact process. Here we discuss the contact process.

**Manufacture of sulphuric acid by contact process:**

The contact process involves the following steps.

i. Initially sulphur dioxide is produced by burning sulphur or iron pyrites in oxygen/air.

ii. Sulphur dioxide formed is oxidised to sulphur trioxide by air in the presence of a catalyst such as V2O5 or platinised asbestos.

iii. The sulphur trioxide is absorbed in concentrated sulphuric acid and produces oleum (H2S2O7). The oleum is converted into sulphuric acid by diluting it with water.

To maximise the yield the plant is operated at 2 bar pressure and 720 K. The sulphuric acid obtained in this process is over 96 % pure.

**Physical properties:**

Pure sulphuric acid is a colourless, viscous liquid (Density: 1.84 g/mL at 298 K). High boiling point and viscosity of sulphuric acid is due to the association of molecules together through hydrogen bonding.

The acid freezes at 283.4 K and boils at 590 K. It is highly soluble in water and has strong affinity towards water and hence it can be used as a dehydrating agent. When dissolved in water, it forms mono (H2SO4.H2O) and dihydrates (H2SO4.2H2O) and the reaction is exothermic.

The dehydrating property can also be illustrated by its reaction with organic compounds such as sugar, oxalic acid and formic acid.

### Manufacture of chlorine:


Chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of brine in electrolytic process or by oxidation of HCl by air in Deacon’s process.

**Electrolytic process:** When a solution of brine (NaCl) is electrolysed, Na+ and Cl- ions are formed. Na+ ion reacts with OH- ions of water and forms sodium hydroxide. Hydrogen and chlorine are liberated as gases.

### Trends in physical and chemical properties of hydrogen halides:


**Preparation:**

Direct combination is a useful means of preparing hydrogen chloride. The reaction between hydrogen and fluorine is violent while the reaction between hydrogen and bromine or hydrogen and iodine are reversible and don’t produce pure forms.

**Displacement reactions:**

Concentrated sulphuric acid displaces hydrogen chloride from ionic chlorides. At higher temperatures the hydrogen sulphate formed react with further ionic chloride. Displacement can be used for the preparation of hydrogen fluorides from ionic fluorides. Hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide are oxidised by concentrated sulphuric acid and can’t be prepared in this method.

**Hydrolysis of phosphorus trihalides:**

Gaseous hydrogen halides are produced when water is added in drops to phosphorus tri halides except phosphorus trifluoride.

In line with the decreasing bond dissociation enthalpy, the thermal stability of hydrogen halides decreases from fluoride to iodide.

For example, Hydrogen iodide decomposes at 400° C while hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride are stable at this temperature.

At room temperature, hydrogen halides are gases but hydrogen fluoride can be readily liquefied. The gases are colourless but, with moist air gives white fumes due to the production of droplets of hydrohalic acid. In HF, due to the presence of strong hydrogen bond it has high melting and boiling points. This effect is absent in other hydrogen halides.

**Acidic properties:**

**The hydrogen halides are extremely soluble in water due to the ionisation.**

(X – F, Cl, Br, or I)

Solutions of hydrogen halides are therefore acidic and known as hydrohalic acids. Hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids are almost completely ionised and are therefore strong acids but HF is a weak acid i.e. 0.1mM solution is only 10% ionised, but in 5M and 15M solution HF is stronger acid due to the equilibrium.

At high concentration, the equilibrium involves the removal of fluoride ions is important. Since it affects the dissociation of hydrogen fluoride and increases and hydrogen ion concentration Several stable salts NaHF2, KHF2 and NH4HF2 are known. The other hydrogen halides do not form hydrogen dihalides.

Hydrohalic acid shows typical acidic properties. They form salts with acids, bases and reacts with metals to give hydrogen. Moist hydrofluoric acid (not dry) rapidly react with silica and glass.

But hydrogen iodide and ionic iodides are rapidly reduced by H2SO4 into H2S and not into SO2.

Reducing property of hydrogen iodide can be also explained by using its reaction with alcohols into ethane. It converts nitric acid into nitrous acid and dinitrogen dioxide into ammonium.

Hydrogen chloride is unaffected by concentrated sulphuric acid but affected by only strong oxidising agents like MnO2, potassium permanganate or potassium chloride.

### Oxides of halogen


Fluorine reacts readily with oxygen and forms difluorine oxide (F2O) and difluorine dioxide (F2O2) where it has a -1 oxidation state. Other halogens do not react with oxygen readily. But the following oxides can be prepared by some indirect methods. Except fluorine all the other halogens have positive oxidation states.

## Group 18 (Inert gases) elements: 3.4.1 Occurrence:


All the noble gases occur in the atmosphere. **Physical properties:**

As we move along the noble gas elements, their atomic radius and boiling point increases from helium to radon. The first ionization energy decreases from helium to radon. Noble gases have the largest ionisation energy compared to any other elements in a given row as they have completely filled orbital in their outer most shell. They are extremely stable and have a small tendency to gain or lose electrons. The common physical properties of the group 18 elements are listed in the Table.

Xenon reacts with PtF6 and gave an orange yellow solid \[XePtF6\] and this is insoluble in CCl4.

Xenon difluoride forms addition compounds XeF2.2SbF5 and XeF2.2TaF5. Xenon hexa fluorides forms compound with boron and alkali metals. Eg : XeF6.BF3, XeF6MF, M-alkali metals.

There is some evidence for existence of xenon dichloride XeCl2.

Krypton form krypton difluoride when an electric discharge is passed through Kr and fluorine at 183° C or when gases are irradiated with SbF5 it forms KrF2.2SbF3.

**Uses of noble gases:**

The inertness of noble gases is an important feature of their practical uses.

**Helium:**

1\. Helium and oxygen mixture is used by divers in place of air oxygen mixture. This prevents the painful dangerous condition called bends.

2\. Helium is used to provide inert atmosphere in electric arc welding of metals

3\. Helium has lowest boiling point hence used in cryogenics (low temperature science).

4\. It is much less denser than air and hence used for filling air balloons

**Neon:**

Neon is used in advertisement as neon sign and the brilliant red glow is caused by passing electric current through neon gas under low pressure.

**Argon:**

Argon prevents the oxidation of hot filament and prolongs the life in filament bulbs

**Krypton:**

Krypton is used in fluorescent bulbs, flash bulbs etc...

Lamps filed with krypton are used in airports as approaching lights as they can penetrate through dense fog.

**Xenon:**

Xenon is used in fluorescent bulbs, flash bulbs and lasers.

Xenon emits an intense light in discharge tubes instantly. Due to this it is used in high speed electronic flash bulbs used by photographers

**Radon:**

Radon is radioactive and used as a source of gamma rays

Radon gas is sealed as small capsules and implanted in the body to destroy malignant i.e. cancer growth

**Summary**

„ **Occurrence:** About 78 % of earth atmosphere contains dinitorgen (N2) gas. It is also present in earth crust as sodium nitrate (Chile saltpetre) and potassium nitrates (Indian saltpetre).

„ **Nitrogen**, the principle gas of atmosphere (78 % by volume) is separated industrially from liquid air by fractional distillation

„ Ammonia is formed by the hydrolysis of urea.

„ Nitric acid is prepared by heating equal amounts of potassium or sodium nitrate with concentrated sulphuric acid.

„ In most of the reactions, nitric acid acts as an oxidising agent. Hence the oxidation state changes from +5 to a lower one. It doesn’t yield hydrogen in its reaction with metals.

„ The reactions of metals with nitric acid are explained in 3 steps as follows:

▶ **Primary reaction:** Metal nitrate is formed with the release of nascent hydrogen

▶ **Secondary reaction:** Nascent hydrogen produces the reduction products of nitric acid.

▶ **Tertiary reaction:** The secondary products either decompose or react to give final products

„ Phosphorus has several allotropic modification of which the three forms namely white, red and black phosphorus are most common.

„ yellow phosphorus is poisonous in nature and has a characteristic garlic smell. It glows in the dark due to oxidation which is called phosphorescence.

„ Yellow phosphorus readily catches fire in air giving dense white fumes of phosphorus pentoxide.

„ Phosphine is prepared by action of sodium hydroxide with white phosphorous in an inert atmosphere of carbon dioxide or hydrogen.

„ Phosphine is used for producing smoke screen as it gives large smoke.

„ When a slow stream of chlorine is passed over white phosphorous, phosphorous trichloride is formed.

„ phosphorus trichloride: and Phosphorous pentachloride are used as a chlorinating agent

„ Oxygen is paramagnetic. It exists in two allotropic forms namely dioxygen (O2) and ozone or trioxygen (O3).

„ Ozone is commonly used for oxidation of organic compounds.

„ Sulphur exists in crystalline as well as amorphous allotrophic forms. The crystalline form includes rhombic sulphur (α sulphur) and monoclinic sulphur (β sulphur). Amorphous allotropic form includes plastic sulphur (γ sulphur), milk of sulphur and colloidal sulphur.

„ Sulphuric acid can be manufactured by lead chamber process, cascade process or contact process.

„ When dissolved in water, it forms mono (H2SO4.H2O) and dihydrates (H2SO4.2H2O) and the reaction is exothermic.

„ Halogens are present in combined form as they are highly reactive.

„ Chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of brine in electrolytic process or by oxidation of HCl by air in Deacon’s process.

„ Chlorine is a strong oxidising and bleaching agent because of the nascent oxygen.

„ When three parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid and one part of concentrated nitric acid are mixed, Aquaregia (Royal water) is obtained. This is used for dissolving gold, platinum etc...

„ Hydrogen halides are extremely soluble in water due to the ionisation.

„ Each halogen combines with other halogens to form a series of compounds called inter halogen compounds.

„ Fluorine reacts readily with oxygen and forms difluorine oxide (F2O) and difluorine dioxide (F2O2) where it has a -1 oxidation state.

„ All the noble gases occur in the atmosphere.

„ They are extremely stable and have a small tendency to gain or lose electrons.

„ Sodium per xenate is very much known for its strong oxidizing property.

„ The inertness of noble gases is an important feature of their practical uses.
