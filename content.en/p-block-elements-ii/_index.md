**p-BLOCK ELEMENTS - II**

**UNIT**

**3**

**Learning Objectives** Aft er studying this unit, the students will be able to

 discuss the preparation and properties of important compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus

 describe the preparation and properties of important compounds of oxygen and sulphur

 describe the preparation, properties of halogens and hydrogen halides

 explain the chemistry of inter-halogen compounds

 describe the occurrence, properties and uses of noble gases

 appreciate the importance of p-block elements and their compounds in day today life.

**Sir William Ramsay, (1852 – 1916)**

Sir William Ramsay was a Scottish chemist who discovered the noble gases. During the years 1885–1890 he published several important papers on the oxides of nitrogen.In August 1894, Ramsay had isolated a new heavy element of air, and he named it "argon", (the Greek word meaning "lazy").In the following years, he worked with Morris Travers and discovered neon, krypton, and xenon. In 1910 he isolated and characterized radon. In recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gases, he was awarded a noble prize in chemistry in 1904. His work in isolating noble gases led to the development of a new section of the periodic table.

**INTRODUCTION**

We have already learnt the general characteristics of p-block elements and the first two group namely icosagens (boron group) and tetragens (carbon group) in the previous unit. In this unit we learn the remaining p-block groups, pnictogens, chalcogens, halogens and inert gases.
