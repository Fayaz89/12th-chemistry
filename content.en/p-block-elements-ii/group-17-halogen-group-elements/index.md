# Chlorine


**Occurrence:**

The halogens are present in combined form as they are highly reactive. The main source of fluorine is fluorspar or fluorite. The other ores of fluorine are cryolite, fluroapatite. The main source of chlorine is sodium chloride from sea water. Bromides and iodides also occur in sea water.

**Physical properties:**

The common physical properties of the group 17 elements are listed in the table.

**Properties:**

Chlorine is highly reactive hence it doesn’t occur free in nature. It is usually distributed as various metal chlorides. The most important chloride is sodium chloride which occurs in sea water.h

**Preparation:**

Chlorine is prepared by the action of conc. sulphuric acid on chlorides in presence of manganese dioxide.

4NaCl + MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> → Cl<sub>2</sub> + MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 4NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O 


It can also be prepared by oxidising hydrochloric acid using various oxidising agents such as manganese dioxide, lead dioxide, potassium permanganate or dichromate.

PbO<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl → PbCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>

MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl →  MnCl<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O+Cl<sub>2</sub>

2KMnO<sub>2</sub> + 16HCl → 2KCl + 2MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O + 5Cl<sub>2</sub>


K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 14HCl → 2KCl + 2CrCl<sub>3</sub> + 7H<sub>2</sub>O + 3Cl<sub>2</sub>



When bleaching powder is treated with mineral acids chlorine is liberated

CaOCl<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl → CaCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>

CaOCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → CaSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>


  



## Manufacture of chlorine:


Chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of brine in electrolytic process or by oxidation of HCl by air in Deacon’s process.

**Electrolytic process:** When a solution of brine (NaCl) is electrolysed, Na+ and Cl- ions are formed. Na+ ion reacts with OH- ions of water and forms sodium hydroxide. Hydrogen and chlorine are liberated as gases.

NaCl \rightarrow Na^+ + Cl^-
H_2O \rightarrow H^+ + OH^-
Na + OH^- \rightarrow NaOH
2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2
\text{At the cathode,} \\
2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 \\
\text{At the anode,} \\
2Cl^- \rightarrow Cl_2 + 2e^-


<!-- ![diagram](electrolytic-process.png) -->


**Deacon’s process:** In this process a mixture of air and hydrochloric acid is passed up a chamber containing a number of shelves, pumice stones soaked in cuprous chloride are placed. Hot gases at about 723 K are passed through a jacket that surrounds the chamber.

$\ce{4HCl+O<sub>2</sub> ->[{(400°C) }][{Cu<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>}] 2H<sub>2</sub>O+2Cl<sub>2</sub>}$ ↑

## Trends in physical and chemical properties of hydrogen halides:


**Preparation:**

Direct combination is a useful means of preparing hydrogen chloride. The reaction between hydrogen and fluorine is violent while the reaction between hydrogen and bromine or hydrogen and iodine are reversible and don’t produce pure forms.

**Displacement reactions:**

Concentrated sulphuric acid displaces hydrogen chloride from ionic chlorides. At higher temperatures the hydrogen sulphate formed react with further ionic chloride. Displacement can be used for the preparation of hydrogen fluorides from ionic fluorides. Hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide are oxidised by concentrated sulphuric acid and can’t be prepared in this method.

**Hydrolysis of phosphorus trihalides:**

Gaseous hydrogen halides are produced when water is added in drops to phosphorus tri halides except phosphorus trifluoride.

PX<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O  → H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> + 3HX 3



Hydrogen bromide may be obtained by adding bromine dropwise to a paste of red phosphorous and water while hydrogen iodide is conveniently produced by adding water dropwise to a mixture of red phosphorous and iodine.

2P + 3X<sub>2</sub> → 2PX<sub>3</sub>

2PX<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>3</sub>O →  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> + 3HX (where X=Br or I)

Any halogen vapours which escapes with the hydrogen halide is removed by passing the gases through a column of moist red phosphorous.

**From covalent hydrides:**

Halogens are reduced to hydrogen halides by hydrogen sulphide.

H<sub>2</sub>S + X<sub>2</sub> →  2HX + S 



Hydrogen chloride is obtained as a by-product of the reactions between hydrocarbon of halogens.


**Table 3.4: General Properties:**
<!-- ![image](general-properties.png) -->
 
| Compound | Bond Dissociation Enthalpy (kJ/mol) | % of Ionic Character |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| HF       | +562                                | 43                   |
| HCl      | +431                                | 17                   |
| HBr      | +366                                | 13                   |
| HI       | +299                                | 7                    |


In line with the decreasing bond dissociation enthalpy, the thermal stability of hydrogen halides decreases from fluoride to iodide.

For example, Hydrogen iodide decomposes at 400° C while hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride are stable at this temperature.

At room temperature, hydrogen halides are gases but hydrogen fluoride can be readily liquefied. The gases are colourless but, with moist air gives white fumes due to the production of droplets of hydrohalic acid. In HF, due to the presence of strong hydrogen bond it has high melting and boiling points. This effect is absent in other hydrogen halides.

**Acidic properties:**

**The hydrogen halides are extremely soluble in water due to the ionisation.**

HX + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + X<sup>-</sup> 

(X – F, Cl, Br, or I)

Solutions of hydrogen halides are therefore acidic and known as hydrohalic acids. Hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids are almost completely ionised and are therefore strong acids but HF is a weak acid i.e. 0.1mM solution is only 10% ionised, but in 5M and 15M solution HF is stronger acid due to the equilibrium.

HF + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌  H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + F<sup>-</sup>

HF + F<sup>-</sup> ⇌  HF<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>


At high concentration, the equilibrium involves the removal of fluoride ions is important. Since it affects the dissociation of hydrogen fluoride and increases and hydrogen ion concentration Several stable salts NaHF2, KHF2 and NH4HF2 are known. The other hydrogen halides do not form hydrogen dihalides.

Hydrohalic acid shows typical acidic properties. They form salts with acids, bases and reacts with metals to give hydrogen. Moist hydrofluoric acid (not dry) rapidly react with silica and glass.
 
SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4HF → SiF<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O

Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub> + 6HF → Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O



**Oxidation:** Hydrogen iodide is readily oxidised to iodine hence it is a reducing agent. 

2HI ⇌  2H<sup>+</sup>+ I<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup>



Acidic solution of iodides is readily oxidised. A positive result is shown by liberation of iodine which gives a blue-black colouration with starch.



Hydrogen bromide is more difficult to oxidise than HI. HBr reduces slowly H2SO4 into SO2

2HBr + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O+ Br<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub>



But hydrogen iodide and ionic iodides are rapidly reduced by H2SO4 into H2S and not into SO2.

8HI + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> →  4H<sub>2</sub>O +4I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S



Reducing property of hydrogen iodide can be also explained by using its reaction with alcohols into ethane. It converts nitric acid into nitrous acid and dinitrogen dioxide into ammonium.

Hydrogen chloride is unaffected by concentrated sulphuric acid but affected by only strong oxidising agents like MnO2, potassium permanganate or potassium chloride.

**Properties of inter halogen compounds:**

i. The central atom will be the larger one

ii. It can be formed only between two halogen and not more than two halogens.



iii. Fluorine can’t act as a central metal atom being the smallest one

iv. Due to high electronegativity with small size fluorine helps the central atom to attain high coordination number

v. They can undergo the auto ionization.

2ICl ⇌  I<sup>+</sup> + ICl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>

2ICl<sub>3</sub> ⇌  ICl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + ICl<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>


vi. They are strong oxidizing agents

**Reaction with alkali:**

When heated with the alkalis, larger halogen form oxyhalogens and the smaller forms halide.

BrF<sub>5</sub>  →  5F<sup>-</sup> + BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>

ICl   →  Cl<sup>-</sup> + OI<sup>-</sup>

## Oxides of halogen


Fluorine reacts readily with oxygen and forms difluorine oxide (F2O) and difluorine dioxide (F2O2) where it has a -1 oxidation state. Other halogens do not react with oxygen readily. But the following oxides can be prepared by some indirect methods. Except fluorine all the other halogens have positive oxidation states.

## Oxoacids of halogens:


Chlorine forms four types of oxoacids namely hypochlorus acid, chlorous acid, chloric acid and perchloric acid. Bromine and iodine forms the similar acids except halous acid. However, flurine only forms hypofulric acid. The oxidizing power oxo acids follows the order:

**HOX > HXO2 > HXO3 > HXO4**
