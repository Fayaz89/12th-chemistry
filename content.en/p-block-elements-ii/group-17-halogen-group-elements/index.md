## Group 17 (Halogen group) elements: 3.3.1 Chlorine


**Occurrence:**

The halogens are present in combined form as they are highly reactive. The main source of fluorine is fluorspar or fluorite. The other ores of fluorine are cryolite, fluroapatite. The main source of chlorine is sodium chloride from sea water. Bromides and iodides also occur in sea water.

**Physical properties:**

The common physical properties of the group 17 elements are listed in the table.

**Properties:**

Chlorine is highly reactive hence it doesn’t occur free in nature. It is usually distributed as various metal chlorides. The most important chloride is sodium chloride which occurs in sea water.

**Preparation:**

Chlorine is prepared by the action of conc. sulphuric acid on chlorides in presence of manganese dioxide.

### Manufacture of chlorine:


Chlorine is manufactured by the electrolysis of brine in electrolytic process or by oxidation of HCl by air in Deacon’s process.

**Electrolytic process:** When a solution of brine (NaCl) is electrolysed, Na+ and Cl- ions are formed. Na+ ion reacts with OH- ions of water and forms sodium hydroxide. Hydrogen and chlorine are liberated as gases.

Chlorine is soluble in water and its solution is referred as chlorine water. It deposits greenish yellow crystals of chlorine hydrate (Cl2.8H2O). It can be converted into liquid (Boiling point – 34.6° C) and yellow crystalline solid (Melting point -102° C)

### Trends in physical and chemical properties of hydrogen halides:


**Preparation:**

Direct combination is a useful means of preparing hydrogen chloride. The reaction between hydrogen and fluorine is violent while the reaction between hydrogen and bromine or hydrogen and iodine are reversible and don’t produce pure forms.

**Displacement reactions:**

Concentrated sulphuric acid displaces hydrogen chloride from ionic chlorides. At higher temperatures the hydrogen sulphate formed react with further ionic chloride. Displacement can be used for the preparation of hydrogen fluorides from ionic fluorides. Hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide are oxidised by concentrated sulphuric acid and can’t be prepared in this method.

**Hydrolysis of phosphorus trihalides:**

Gaseous hydrogen halides are produced when water is added in drops to phosphorus tri halides except phosphorus trifluoride.

Hydrogen bromide may be obtained by adding bromine dropwise to a paste of red phosphorous and water while hydrogen iodide is conveniently produced by adding water dropwise to a mixture of red phosphorous and iodine.

In line with the decreasing bond dissociation enthalpy, the thermal stability of hydrogen halides decreases from fluoride to iodide.

For example, Hydrogen iodide decomposes at 400° C while hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride are stable at this temperature.

At room temperature, hydrogen halides are gases but hydrogen fluoride can be readily liquefied. The gases are colourless but, with moist air gives white fumes due to the production of droplets of hydrohalic acid. In HF, due to the presence of strong hydrogen bond it has high melting and boiling points. This effect is absent in other hydrogen halides.

**Acidic properties:**

**The hydrogen halides are extremely soluble in water due to the ionisation.**

(X – F, Cl, Br, or I)

Solutions of hydrogen halides are therefore acidic and known as hydrohalic acids. Hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids are almost completely ionised and are therefore strong acids but HF is a weak acid i.e. 0.1mM solution is only 10% ionised, but in 5M and 15M solution HF is stronger acid due to the equilibrium.

At high concentration, the equilibrium involves the removal of fluoride ions is important. Since it affects the dissociation of hydrogen fluoride and increases and hydrogen ion concentration Several stable salts NaHF2, KHF2 and NH4HF2 are known. The other hydrogen halides do not form hydrogen dihalides.

Hydrohalic acid shows typical acidic properties. They form salts with acids, bases and reacts with metals to give hydrogen. Moist hydrofluoric acid (not dry) rapidly react with silica and glass.

Hydrogen bromide is more difficult to oxidise than HI. HBr reduces slowly H2SO4 into SO2

But hydrogen iodide and ionic iodides are rapidly reduced by H2SO4 into H2S and not into SO2.

Reducing property of hydrogen iodide can be also explained by using its reaction with alcohols into ethane. It converts nitric acid into nitrous acid and dinitrogen dioxide into ammonium.

Hydrogen chloride is unaffected by concentrated sulphuric acid but affected by only strong oxidising agents like MnO2, potassium permanganate or potassium chloride.

To summarize the trend,

Fluorine reacts readily with oxygen and forms difluorine oxide (F2O) and difluorine dioxide (F2O2) where it has a -1 oxidation state. Other halogens do not react with oxygen readily. But the following oxides can be prepared by some indirect methods. Except fluorine all the other halogens have positive oxidation states.
