## Solubility Product
 We have come across many precipitation reactions in inorganic qualitative analysis. For

example, dil HCl is used to precipitate Pb2+ ions as PbCl2 which is sparingly soluble in water. Kidney stones are developed over a period of time due to the precipitation of Ca2+ (as calcium oxalate etc…). To understand the precipitation, let us consider the solubility equilibria that exist between the undissociated sparingly soluble salt and its constituent ions in solution.

For a general salt X Y m n

, X Y (s) mX (aq) + nY (aq)

m n

H O n+ m-2 →← 

The equilibrium constant for the above is

K = \[X \] \[Y \] \[X Y \]

n+ m m- n

m m

In solubility equilibria, the equilibrium constant is referred as solubility product constant (or) Solubility product.

In such heterogeneous equilibria, the concentration of the solid is a constant and is omitted in the above expression

K = \[X \] \[Y \]sp n+ m m- n

The solubility product of a compound is defined as the product of the molar concentration of the constituent ions, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric co – efficient in a balanced equilibrium equation.

Solubility product finds useful to decide whether an ionic compound gets precipitated when solution that contains the constituent ions are mixed.

When the product of molar concentration of the constituent ions i.e., ionic product, exceeds the solubility product then the compound gets precipitated.

The expression for the solubility product and the ionic product appears to be the same but in the solubility product expression, the molar concentration represents the equilibrium concentration and in ionic product, the initial concentration (or) concentration at a given time ‘t’ is used.

In general we can summarise as, Ionic product > Ksp , precipitation will occur and the solution is super saturated. Ionic product < Ksp , no precipitation and the solution is unsaturated. Ionic product = Ksp , equilibrium exist and the solution is saturated.

**Example 8.9**

Indicate find out whether lead chloride gets precipitated or not when 1 mL of 0.1M lead nitrate and 0.5 mL of 0.2 M NaCl solution are mixed? Ksp of PbCl2 is 1.2 10

### Determination of solubility product from molar solubility


Solubility product can be calculated from the molar solubility i.e., the maximum number of moles of solute that can be dissolved in one litre of the solution.

For a solute X Y ,m n

X Y (s) mX (aq) +nY (aq)m n n+ m-



From the above stoichiometrically balanced equation we have come to know that 1 mole of X Y (s)m n dissociated to furnish ‘m’ moles of Xn+ and ‘n’ moles of Ym- if ‘s’ is molar solubility of X Y ,m n then

\[X \]=ms and \[ Y \]=ns K = \[X \] \[Y \]

**Summary**

„ According to Arrhenius, an acid is a substance that dissociates to give hydrogen ions in water.

„ According to Lowry and Bronsted concept, an acid is defined as a substance that has a tendency to donate a proton to another substance and base is a substance that has a tendency to accept a proton from other substance.

„ According to Gilbert . N. Lewis , an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while base is a species that donates an electron pair.

„ ionic product (ionic product constant) of water (Kw)=\[H3O

+\]\[OH–\]

„ pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of base 10 of the molar concentration of the hydronium ions present in the solution.

pH = –log 10 \[H3O +\]

„ when dilution increases, the degree of dissociation of weak electrolyte also increases. This statement is known as Ostwald’s dilution Law.

„ When a salt of a weak acid is added to the acid itself, the dissociation of the weak acid is suppressed further this is known as common ion effect

„ Buffer is a solution which consists of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or) a weak base and its conjugate acid.

„ Buffer capacity and buffer index is defined as the number of gram equivalents of acid or base added to 1

litre of the buffer solution to change its pH by unity.

β= dB d(pH)
