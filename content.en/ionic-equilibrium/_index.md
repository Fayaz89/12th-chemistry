**INTRODUCTION**

We have already learnt the chemical equilibrium in XI standard. In this unit, we discuss the ionic equilibria, specifically acid – base equilibria. Some of the important processes in our body involve aqueous equilibria. For example, the carbonic acid – bicarbonate buffer in the blood.

We have come across many chemical compounds in our daily life among them acids and bases are the most common. For example, milk contains lactic acid, vinegar acetic acid, tea tannic acid and antacid tablet aluminium hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide. Acids and bases have many important industrial applications. For example, sulphuric acid is used in fertilizer industry and sodium hydroxide in soap industry etc… Hence, it is important to understand the properties of acids and bases.

In this unit we shall learn the definitions of acids and bases and study, their ionisation in aqueous solution. We learn the pH scale and also apply the principles of chemical equilibrium to determine the concentration of the species furnished in aqueous solution by acids and bases.

## Acids and bases
 The term ‘acid’ is derived from the latin word ‘acidus’ meaning sour. We have already

learnt in earlier classes that acid tastes sour, turns the blue litmus to red and reacts with metals such as zinc and produces hydrogen gas. Similarly base tastes bitter and turns the red litmus to blue.

These classical concepts are not adequate to explain the complete behaviour of acids and bases. So, the scientists developed the acid – base concept based on their behaviour.

Let us, learn the concept developed by scientists Arrhenius, Bronsted and Lowry and Lewis to describe the properties of acids and bases.

### Arrhenius Concept


One of the earliest theories about acids and bases was proposed by swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius. According to him, an acid is a substance that dissociates to give hydrogen ions in water. For example, HCl, H SO2 4 etc., are acids. Their dissociation in aqueous solution is expressed as

HCl(g) H (aq)+Cl (aq)H O + -2 ⇀↽ 

The H+ ion in aqueous solution is highly hydrated and usually represented as H O3 + ,

the simplest hydrate of proton H(H O)2

+\[ \] . We use both H and H O+ 3

\+ to mean the same.

Similarly a base is a substance that dissociates to give hydroxyl ions in water. For example, substances like NaOH, Ca(OH)2 etc., are bases.

Ca(OH) Ca (aq)+2OH (aq)2 H O 2+2 - ⇀↽

**Limitations of Arrhenius concept**

i. Arrhenius theory does not explain the behaviour of acids and bases in non aqueous solvents such as acetone, Tetrahydrofuran etc...

ii. This theory does not account for the basicity of the substances like ammonia ( NH3 ) which do not possess hydroxyl group.

### Lowry – Bronsted Theory (Proton Theory)


In 1923, Lowry and Bronsted suggested a more general definition of acids and bases. According to their concept, an acid is defined as a substance that has a tendency to donate a proton to another substance and base is a substance that has a tendency to accept a proton from other substance. In other words, an acid is a proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor.

When hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water, it donates a proton to the later. Thus, HCl behaves as an acid and H O2 is base. The proton transfer from the acid to base can be represented as

HCl+H O H O +Cl2 3 + -



When ammonia is dissolved in water, it accepts a proton from water. In this case, ammonia ( NH3 ) acts as a base and H O2 is acid. The reaction is represented as

H O+NH NH +OH2 3 4 + -

Let us consider the reverse reaction in the following equilibrium

Proton acceptor (Base) 3

+

Pr 

oton donar (acid) Proton acceptor (Base) + Cl-

H O3 + donates a proton to Cl- to form HCl i.e., the products also behave as acid and base.

In general, Lowry – Bronsted (acid – base) reaction is represented as

Acid +Base Acid +Base 1 2 2 1



The species that remains after the donation of a proton is a base (Base1)and is called the conjugate base of the Bronsted acid Acid 1( ) . In other words, chemical species that differ only by a proton are called conjugate acid – base pairs.

### Lewis concept


In 1923, Gilbert . N. Lewis proposed a more generalised concept of acids and bases. He considered the electron pair to define a species as an acid (or) a base. According to him, an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while base is a species that donates an electron pair. We call such species as Lewis acids and bases.

A Lewis acid is a positive ion (or) an electron deficient molecule and a Lewis base is a anion (or) neutral molecule with at least one lone pair of electrons.

Here, boron has a vacant 2p orbital to accept the lone pair of electrons donated by ammonia to form a new coordinate covalent bond. We have already learnt that in coordination compounds, the Ligands act as a Lewis base and the central metal atom or ion that accepts a pair of electrons from the ligand behaves as a Lewis acid.

## Strength of Acids and Bases
 The strength of acids and bases can be determined by the concentration of H O (or) OH3

\+ -

produced per mole of the substance dissolved in H O2 . Generally we classify the acids / bases either as strong or weak. A strong acid is the one that is almost completely dissociated in water while a weak acid is only partially dissociated in water.

Let us quantitatively define the strength of an acid (HA) by considering the following general equilibrium.

We can omit the concentration of H O2 in the above expression since it is present in large excess and essentially unchanged.

K = \[H O \]\[A \]

.....(8.2)

Here, Ka is called the ionisation constant or dissociation constant of the acid. It measures the strength of an acid. Acids such as HCl,HNO3 etc... are almost completely ionised and hence they have high Ka value (K for HCl at 25 C is 2×10 )

a

o 6 Acids such as formic acid (K =1.8 10 at 25 Ca

\-4 o× ) , acetic acid (1.8 10 at 25 C-5 o× ) etc.. are partially ionised in solution and in such cases, there is an equilibrium between the unionised acid molecules and their dissociated ions. Generally, acids with K

a value greater than ten are considered as strong acids

and less than one are considered as weak acids.

Let us consider the dissociation of HCl in aqueous solution,

HCl + H - OH H O + Cl acid 1 base 2 acid 2 base 1

3 + -



As discussed earlier, due to the complete dissociation, the equilibrium lies almost 100% to the right. i.e., the Cl- ion has only a negligible tendency to accept a proton form H O3

\+ . It means that the conjugate base of a strong acid is a weak base and vice versa.

The following table illustrates the relative strength of conjugate acid – base pairs.

## Ionisation of water
 We have learnt that when an acidic or a basic substance is dissolved in water, depending

upon its nature, it can either donate (or) accept a proton. In addition to that the pure water itself has a little tendency to dissociate. i.e, one water molecule donates a proton to an another water molecule. This is known as auto ionisation of water and it is represented as below.

Conjugate acid - base pairs

**. .** \+ -

2 3acid 1 base 1base 2 acid 2 HO-H+H O H O +OH

In the above ionisation, one water molecule acts as an acid while the another water molecule acts as a base.

The dissociation constant for the above ionisation is given by the following expression

K= \[H O \]\[OH \]

\[H O\] 3

2 2 .....(8.3)

The concentration of pure liquid water is one. i.e, \[H O\] 2

2 = 1

 K =\[H O \]\[OH \]w 3 + - .....(8.4)

Here, Kw represents the ionic product (ionic product constant) of water

It was experimentally found that the concentration of H O3 + in pure water is -7 o1×10 at 25 C .

Since the dissociation of water produces equal number of H O and OH3 + -

, the concentration of OH- is also equal to 1×10 at 25 C

\-7 o .

Therefore, the ionic product of water oat 25 C is

Kw =\[H3O\]+\[OH-\]......(8.4)

Kw =(1 10-7)(1 10-7)

\= 1 1

× ×

× 0-14.

Like all equilibrium constants, Kw is also a constant at a particular temperature. The dissociation of water is an endothermic reaction. With the increase in temperature, the concentration of H O3

\+ and OH - also increases, and hence the

ionic product also increases.

In neutral aqueous solution like NaCl solution, the concentration of H O3

\+ is always equal to the concentration of OH

\- whereas in case of an aqueous solution of a substance which may behave as an acid (or) a base, the concentration of H O

3

\+ will not be equal to \[OH-\] .

We can understand this by considering the aqueous HCl as an example. In addition to the auto ionisation of water, the following equilibrium due to the dissociation of HCl can also exist.

HCl+H2O H3O +Cl-+ 

In this case, in addition to the auto ionisation of water, HCl molecules also produces H3O

\+ ion by donating a proton to water and hence \[H O \]>\[OH-\]3 + . It means that the aqueous

HCl solution is acidic. Similarly, in basic solution such as aqueous NH 3 , NaOH etc…..

\[OH–\]>\[H3O +\].

## The pH scale
 We usually deal with acid / base solution in the concentration range 10-1 to 10 M-7 . To

express the strength of such low concentrations, Sorensen introduced a logarithmic scale known as the pH scale. The term pH is derived from the French word ‘Purissance de hydrogene’ meaning, the power of hydrogen. pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of base 10 of the molar concentration of the hydronium ions present in the solution.

pH = - log \[H O \]10 3 +

.....(8.5) The concentration of H O

3

\+ in a solution of known pH can be calculated using the following expression.

\[H3O+\]=10-pH (or) \[H3O+\]= antilog of (-pH) .....(8.6)

Similarly, pOH can also be defined as follows pOH = - log \[OH

\- \]

10 .....(8.7)

As discussed earlier, in neutral solutions, the concentration of \[H O \]3 + as well as \[OH \]

\+ is equal to 1 10-7M at 25 C×  . The pH of a neutral solution can be calculated by substituting this H3O

+concentration in the expression (8.5)

pH = log 10 \[H3O+\]

\= log 10 10-7

\= lo

\- -

g 10 10 10= +7 (1)= 7 \[ log 10=1\](-7)(-1)

Similary, we can calculate the pOH of a neutral solution using the expression (8.7), it is also equal to 7.

The negative sign in the expression (8.5) indicates that when the concentration of \[H O \] 3

\+ increases the pH value decreases. For example, if the +

3\[H O \] increases from to 10 to10 M-7 -5 , the pH value of the solution decreases from 7 to 5. We know that in acidic solution, \[H O \] > \[OH \]

3

\+ - , i.e., \[H O \] > 10-7 3

\+ . Similarly in basic solution + 7 3

\-\[H O \] < 10 . So, we can conclude that acidic solution should have pH value less than 7 and basic solution should have pH value greater than 7.

### Relation between pH and pOH

similarly, \[OH-\]=10-7M (from water) + \[OH-\] (from the base)

**Example 8.3**

**Calculate pH of** 10 7- **M HCl** If we do not consider \[H O \]3

## Ionisation of weak acids
 We have already learnt that weak acids are partially dissociated in water and there is an

equilibrium between the undissociated acid and its dissociated ions.

Consider the ionisation of a weak monobasic acid HA in water.

moles per litre.

In dilute solutions, water is present in large excess and hence, its concentration may be taken as constant say K. Further H O3

\+ indicates that hydrogen ion is hydrated, for simplicity it may be replaced by H+ . The above equation may then be written as,

K = \[H \]\[A \] \[HA\] KC

\+ -

× .....(8.10) The product of the two constants KC and K gives another constant. Let it be Ka

K =\[H \]\[A \] \[HA\]a

\+ -

.....(8.11) The constant Ka is called dissociation constant of the acid. Like other equilibrium

constants, aK also varies only with temperature.

Similarly, for a weak base, the dissociation constant can be written as below.

K =\[B \]\[OH \] \[BOH\]b

\+ -

....(8.12) ### Ostwald’s dilution law


Ostwald’s dilution law relates the dissociation constant of the weak acid (K )a with its degree of dissociation ( )α and the concentration (c). Degree of dissociation ( )α is the fraction of the total number of moles of a substance that dissociates at equilibrium.

i.e, When the dilution increases by 100 times, (Concentration decreases from 1 10 M-2× to 1 10 M-4× ), the dissociation increases by 10 times.

## Common Ion Effect
 When a salt of a weak acid is added to the acid itself, the dissociation of the weak acid is

suppressed further. For example, the addition of sodium acetate to acetic acid solution leads to the suppression in the dissociation of acetic acid which is already weakly dissociated. In this case, CH COOH3 and CH COONa3 have the common ion, CH COO

3

\-

Let us analyse why this happens. Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is not completely dissociated in aqueous solution and hence the following equilibrium exists.

CH COOH(aq) H (aq)+CH COO (aq) 3

+

3

\- 

However, the added salt, sodium acetate, completely dissociates to produce Na+ and CH COO3

\- ion.

CH COONa(aq) Na (aq)+CH COO (aq)3 +

3 -→

Hence, the overall concentration of CH COO 3

\- is increased, and the acid dissociation equilibrium is disturbed. We know from Le chatelier's principle that when a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system adjusts itself to nullify the effect produced by that stress. So, inorder to maintain the equilibrium, the excess CH COO3

\- ions combines with H+ ions to produce much more unionized CH COOH

3 i.e, the equilibrium will shift towards the left. In other words, the dissociation of CH COOH3 is suppressed. Thus, the dissociation of a weak acid (CH3COOH) is suppressed in the presence of a salt (CH3COONa) containing an ion common to the weak electrolyte. It is called the common ion effect.

## Buffer Solution
 Do you know that our blood maintains a constant pH, irrespective of a number of cellular

acid – base reactions. Is it possible to maintain a constant hydronium ion concentration in such reactions? Yes, it is possible due to buffer action.

Buffer is a solution which consists of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or) a weak base and its conjugate acid. This buffer solution resists drastic changes in its pH upon addition of a small quantities of acids (or) bases, and this ability is called buffer action. The buffer containing carbonic acid (H CO2 3 ) and its conjugate base HCO3

\- is present in our blood. There are two types of buffer solutions.

**1\. Acidic buffer solution : a solution containing a weak acid and its salt.**

Example : solution containing acetic acid and sodium acetate

**2\. Basic buffer solution : a solution containing a weak base and its salt.**

Example : Solution containing NH OH4 and NH Cl 4

### Buffer action


To resist changes in its pH on the addition of an acid (or) a base, the buffer solution should contain both acidic as well as basic components so as to neutralize the effect of added acid (or) base and at the same time, these components should not consume each other.

Let us explain the buffer action in a solution containing CH COOH3 and CH COONa 3

. The dissociation of the buffer components occurs as below.

CH3COOH (aq) CH3 - COO(aq) + H3O+(aq)

\-

If an acid is added to this mixture, it will be consumed by the conjugate base CH COO3 - to

form the undissociated weak acid i.e, the increase in the concentration of H+ does not reduce the pH significantly.

\+ H CH3COOH (aq)(aq)(aq)CH3COO

If a base is added, it will be neutralized by H3O +, and the acetic acid is dissociated to

maintain the equlibrium. Hence the pH is not significantly altered.

OH (aq) + CH3COOH (aq) CH3COO (aq) + H2O (l)

CH3COOH (aq) CH3COO (aq) + H2O (l)

OH (aq) + (aq) H2O (l)H3O +

(aq)H3O +

These neutralization reactions are identical to those reactions that we have already discussed in common ion effect.

The addition of a strong base (0.01 M NaOH) increased the pH only slightly ie., from 4.74 to 4.75 . So, the buffer action is verified.

### Buffer capacity and buffer index
 The buffering ability of a solution can be measured in terms of buffer capacity. Vanslyke

introduced a quantity called buffer index, β , as a quantitative measure of the buffer capacity. It is defined as the number of gram equivalents of acid or base added to 1 litre of the buffer solution to change its pH by unity.

β= dB d(pH)

....(8.19) Here,

dB = number of gram equivalents of acid / base added to one litre of buffer solution.

d(pH) = The change in the pH after the addition of acid / base.

### Henderson – Hasselbalch equation
 We have already learnt that the concentration of hydronium ion in an acidic buffer solution

depends on the ratio of the concentration of the weak acid to the concentration of its conjugate base present in the solution i.e.,

The weak acid is dissociated only to a small extent. Moreover, due to common ion effect, the dissociation is further suppressed and hence the equilibrium concentration of the acid is nearly equal to the initial concentration of the unionised acid. Similarly, the concentration of the conjugate base is nearly equal to the initial concentration of the added salt.

## Salt Hydrolysis
 When an acid reacts with a base, a salt and water are formed and the reaction is called neutralization. Salts completely dissociate in aqueous solutions to give their constituent ions. The ions so produced are hydrated in water. In certain cases, the cation, anion or both react with water and the reaction is called salt hydrolysis. Hence, salt hydrolysis is the reverse of neutralization reaction.

### Salts of strong acid and a strong base


Let us consider the reaction between NaOH and nitric acid to give sodium nitrate and water.

NaOH(aq)+HNO (aq) NaNO (aq)+H O(l) 3 3 2

The salt NaNO3 completely dissociates in water to produce Na+ and NO3 − ions.

Water dissociates to a small extent as

H O(l) H (aq)+OH (aq)2 + -



Since \[H \]=\[OH \],+ - water is neutral

NO3 - ion is the conjugate base of the strong acid HNO3 and hence it has no tendency to

react with H+ .

Similarly, Na+ is the conjugate acid of the strong base NaOH and it has no tendency to react with OH- .

It means that there is no hydrolysis. In such cases \[H \]=\[OH \]+ - pH is maintained and, therefore, the solution is neutral.

## Solubility Product
 We have come across many precipitation reactions in inorganic qualitative analysis. For

example, dil HCl is used to precipitate Pb2+ ions as PbCl2 which is sparingly soluble in water. Kidney stones are developed over a period of time due to the precipitation of Ca2+ (as calcium oxalate etc…). To understand the precipitation, let us consider the solubility equilibria that exist between the undissociated sparingly soluble salt and its constituent ions in solution.

For a general salt X Y m n

, X Y (s) mX (aq) + nY (aq)

m n

H O n+ m-2 →← 

The equilibrium constant for the above is

K = \[X \] \[Y \] \[X Y \]

In solubility equilibria, the equilibrium constant is referred as solubility product constant (or) Solubility product.

25

In such heterogeneous equilibria, the concentration of the solid is a constant and is omitted in the above expression

K = \[X \] \[Y \]sp n+ m m- n

The solubility product of a compound is defined as the product of the molar concentration of the constituent ions, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric co – efficient in a balanced equilibrium equation.

Solubility product finds useful to decide whether an ionic compound gets precipitated when solution that contains the constituent ions are mixed.

When the product of molar concentration of the constituent ions i.e., ionic product, exceeds the solubility product then the compound gets precipitated.

The expression for the solubility product and the ionic product appears to be the same but in the solubility product expression, the molar concentration represents the equilibrium concentration and in ionic product, the initial concentration (or) concentration at a given time ‘t’ is used.

In general we can summarise as, Ionic product > Ksp , precipitation will occur and the solution is super saturated. Ionic product < Ksp , no precipitation and the solution is unsaturated. Ionic product = Ksp , equilibrium exist and the solution is saturated.

**Example 8.9**

**Summary**

„ According to Arrhenius, an acid is a substance that dissociates to give hydrogen ions in water.

„ According to Lowry and Bronsted concept, an acid is defined as a substance that has a tendency to donate a proton to another substance and base is a substance that has a tendency to accept a proton from other substance.

„ According to Gilbert . N. Lewis , an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while base is a species that donates an electron pair.

„ ionic product (ionic product constant) of water (Kw)=\[H3O

+\]\[OH–\]

„ pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of base 10 of the molar concentration of the hydronium ions present in the solution.

pH = –log 10 \[H3O +\]

„ when dilution increases, the degree of dissociation of weak electrolyte also increases. This statement is known as Ostwald’s dilution Law.

„ When a salt of a weak acid is added to the acid itself, the dissociation of the weak acid is suppressed further this is known as common ion effect

„ Buffer is a solution which consists of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or) a weak base and its conjugate acid.

„ Buffer capacity and buffer index is defined as the number of gram equivalents of acid or base added to 1

litre of the buffer solution to change its pH by unity.

β= dB d(pH)

„ Henderson – Hasselbalch equation

For Acid buffer

⇒ + pH = pK log \[salt\] \[acid\]a

For Basic buffer

⇒ +pOH = pK log \[salt\] \[base\]b
