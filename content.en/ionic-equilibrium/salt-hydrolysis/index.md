## Salt Hydrolysis
 When an acid reacts with a base, a salt and water are formed and the reaction is called neutralization. Salts completely dissociate in aqueous solutions to give their constituent ions. The ions so produced are hydrated in water. In certain cases, the cation, anion or both react with water and the reaction is called salt hydrolysis. Hence, salt hydrolysis is the reverse of neutralization reaction.

### Salts of strong acid and a strong base


Let us consider the reaction between NaOH and nitric acid to give sodium nitrate and water.

NaOH(aq)+HNO (aq) NaNO (aq)+H O(l) 3 3 2

→

The salt NaNO3 completely dissociates in water to produce Na+ and NO3 − ions.

NaNO (aq) Na (aq)+NO (aq)3 +

3 -→

Water dissociates to a small extent as

H O(l) H (aq)+OH (aq)2 + -



Since \[H \]=\[OH \],+ - water is neutral

NO3 - ion is the conjugate base of the strong acid HNO3 and hence it has no tendency to

react with H+ .

Similarly, Na+ is the conjugate acid of the strong base NaOH and it has no tendency to react with OH- .

It means that there is no hydrolysis. In such cases \[H \]=\[OH \]+ - pH is maintained and, therefore, the solution is neutral.

### Hydrolysis of Salt of strong base and weak acid (Anionic Hydrolysis).


Let us consider the reactions between sodium hydroxide and acetic acid to give sodium acetate and water.

In aqueous solution, CH COONa3 is completely dissociated as below

CH COONa (aq) CH COO (aq)+Na (aq)3 3 - +→

CH COO3 -

is a conjugate base of the weak acid CH COOH3 and it has a tendency to react with H+ from water to produce unionised acid .

There is no such tendency for Na+ to react with OH- .

CH COO (aq) + H O(l) CH COOH (aq) + OH (aq)3 -

2 3 -

 and therefore \[OH \]>\[H \]- + , in such cases, the solution is basic due to hydrolysis and the pH is greater than 7.

Let us find a relation between the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis reaction (hydrolysis constant) and the dissociation constant of the acid.

The nature of the solution depends on the strength of acid (or) base i.e, if K >K ; a b then the solution is acidic and pH < 7, if K < Ka b ; then the solution is basic and pH > 7, if K =Ka b ; then the solution is neutral.

The relation between the dissociation constant (K ,Ka b ) and the hydrolysis constant is given by the following expression.

K .K .K =Ka b h w

**pH of the solution**

pH of the solution can be calculated using the following expression,

pH = 7 + 1 2 pK pKa b−1
