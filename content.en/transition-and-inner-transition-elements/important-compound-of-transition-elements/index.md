## important compound of Transition elements Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals


Generally, transition metal oxides are formed by the reaction of transition metals with molecular oxygen at high temperatures. Except the first member of 3d series, Scandium, all other transition elements form ionic metal oxides. The oxidation number of metal in metal oxides ranges from +2 to +7. As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character decreases, for example, Mn2O7 is covalent. Mostly higher oxides are acidic in nature, Mn2O7 dissolves in water to give permanganic acid (HMnO4 ) , similarly CrO3 gives chromic acid (H2CrO4) and dichromic acid (H2Cr2O7). Generally lower oxides may be amphoteric or basic, for example, Chromium (III) oxide - Cr2O3, is amphoteric and Chromium(II) oxide, CrO, is basic in nature.

**Potassium dichromate K2Cr2O7 Preparation:** Potassium dichromate is prepared from chromate ore. The ore is concentrated by gravity separation. It is then mixed with excess sodium carbonate and lime and roasted in a reverbratory furnace.

The roasted mass is treated with water to separate soluble sodium chromate from insoluble iron oxide. The yellow solution of sodium chromate is treated with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts sodium chromate into sodium dichromate.

The above solution is concentrated to remove less soluble sodium sulphate. The resulting solution is filtered and further concentrated. It is cooled to get the crystals of Na2SO4.2H2O.

The saturated solution of sodium dichromate in water is mixed with KCl and then concentrated to get crystals of NaCl. It is filtered while hot and the filtrate is cooled to obtain K2Cr2O7 crystals.

**Physical properties:**

Potassium dichromate is an orange red crystalline solid which melts at 671K and it is moderately soluble in cold water, but very much soluble in hot water. On heating it decomposes and forms Cr2O3 and molecular oxygen. As it emits toxic chromium fumes upon heating, it is mainly replaced by sodium dichromate.

**Structure of dichromate ion:**

Both chromate and dichromate ion are oxo anions of chromium and they are moderately

strong oxidizing agents. In these ions chromium is in +6 oxidation state. In an aqueous solution, chromate and dichromate ions can be interconvertible, and in an alkaline solution chromate ion is predominant, whereas dichromate ion becomes predominant in acidic solutions. Structures of these ions are shown in the fi gure.

**Chemical properties:**

**Potassium permanganate - KMnO4**

**Preparation:**

Potassium permanganate is prepared from pyrolusite (MnO2) ore. The preparation involves the following steps.

(i) Conversion of MnO2 to potassium manganate: Powdered ore is fused with KOH in the presence of air or oxidising agents like KNO3 or

KClO3. A green coloured potassium manganate is formed.

**Uses of potassium permanganate:**

Some important uses of potassium permanganate are listed below.

1\. It is used as a strong oxidizing agent.

2\. It is used for the treatment of various skin infections and fungal infections of the foot.

3\. It used in water treatment industries to remove iron and hydrogen sulphide from well water.

4\. It is used as Bayer’s reagent for detecting unsaturation in an organic compound.

5\. It is used in quantitative analysis for the estimation of ferrous salts, oxalates, hydrogen peroxide and iodides.

**Note** HCl cannot be used for making the medium acidic since it reacts with KMnO4 as follows.

**f-block elements – Inner transition elements**

In the inner transition elements there are two series of elements.

1) Lanthanoids ( previously called lanthanides)

2) Actinoids ( previously called actinides)

Lanthanoid series consists of fourteen elements from Cerium (58Ce) to Lutetium (71Lu) following Lanthanum (57La).These elements are characterised by the preferential filling of 4f orbitals, Similarly actinoids consists of 14 elements from Thorium (90Th) to Lawrencium (103Lr) following Actinium (89Ac).These elements are characterised by the preferential filling of 5f orbital.

**The position of Lanthanoids in the periodic table**

The actual position of Lanthanoids in the periodic table is at group number 3 and period

number 6.However, in the sixth period after lanthanum, the electrons are preferentially filled in inner 4f sub shell and these fourteen elements following lanthanum show similar chemical properties. Therefore these elements are grouped together and placed at the bottom of the periodic table. This position can be justified as follows.

1\. Lanthanoids have general electronic configuration \[Xe\] f d s4 5 61 14 0 1 2− −

2\. The common oxidation state of lanthanoides is +3

3\. All these elements have similar physical and chemical properties.

Similarly the fourteen elements following actinium resemble in their physical and chemical properties. If we place these elements after Lanthanum in the periodic table below 4d series, the properties of the elements belongs to a group would be different and it would affect the proper structure of the periodic table. Hence a separate position is provided to the inner transition elements as shown in the figure.

**Oxidation state of lanthanoids:**

The common oxidation state of lanthanoids is +3. In addition to that some of the lanthanoids also show either +2 or +4 oxidation states.

Gd3+ and Lu3+ ions have extra stability, it is due to the fact that they have exactly half filled and completely filled f-orbitals respectively.their electronic c onfigurations are

Similarly Cerium and terbium attain 4f0 and 4f7 configurations respectively in the +4 oxidation states. Eu2+ and Yb2+ ions have exactly half filled and completely filled f orbitals respectively.

The stability of different oxidation states has an impact on the properties of these elements. the following table shows the different oxidation states of lanthanoids.

**Atomic and ionic radii:**

As we move across 4f series, the atomic and ionic radii of lanthanoids show gradual decrease with increse in atomic number. This decrese in ionic size is called lanthanoid contraction.

**Cause of lanthanoid contraction:**

As we move from one element to another in 4f series ( Ce to Lu) the nuclear charge increases by one unit and an additional electron is added into the same inner 4f sub shell. We know that 4f sub shell have a diffused shapes and therefore the shielding effect of 4f elelctrons relatively poor.hence, with increase of nuclear charge, the valence shell is pulled slightly towards nucleus. As a result, the effetive nuclear charge experienced by the 4f elelctorns increases and the size of Ln3+ ions decreases. Lanthanoid contraction of various lanthanoids is shown in the graph

**Consequences of lanthanoid contraction: 1. Basicity differences**

As we from Ce3+ to Lu3+ , the basic character of Ln3+ ions decrease. Due to the decrease in the size of Ln3+ ions, the ionic character of Ln OH− bond decreases (covalent character increases) which results in the decrease in the basicity. **2\. Similarities among lanthanoids:**

In the complete f - series only 10 pm decrease in atomic radii and 20 pm decrease in ionic radii is observed. because of this very small change in radii of lanthanoids, their chemical properties are quite similar.

**Actinoids:**

The fourteen elements following actinium ,i.e., from thorium (Th) to lawrentium (Lr) are called actinoids. Unlike the lanthanoids, all the actinoids are radioactive and most of them have short half lives. Only thorium and uranium(U) occur in significant amount in nature and a trace amounts of Plutonium(Pu) is also found in Uranium ores.Neptunium(Np) and successive heavier elements are produced synthetically by the artificial transformation of naturally occuring elements by nuclear reactions.

Similar to lanthanoids, they are placed at the bottom of the periodic table. **Electronic configuration:**

The electronic configuration of actinoids is not definite. The general valence shell electronic configuration of 5f elements is represented as \[Rn\]5f 0-146d0-27s2. The following table show the electronic configuration of actinoids.

**Summary**

„ IUPAC defines transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub shell or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub shell. They occupy the central position of the periodic table, between s and p block elements,

„ d- Block elements composed of 3d series (4th period) Scandium to Zinc ( 10 elements), 4d series ( 5th period) Yttrium to Cadmium ( 10 elements) and 5d series ( 6th period) Lanthanum, Haffinium to mercury.

„ the general electronic configuration of d- block elements can be written as \[ \]Noble gas n d ns−( ) − −1 1 10 1 2, Here, n = 4 to 7 . In periods 6 and 7, the configuration includes (_n f_−( )2 orbital ; \[ \]Noble gas n 2 f n d ns14−( ) −( ) − −1 1 10 1 2 .

„ All the transition elements are metals. Similar to all metals the transition metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Unlike the metals of Group-1 and group-2, all the transition metals except group 11 elements are hard.

„ As we move from left to right along the transition metal series, melting point first increases as the number of unpaired d electrons available for metallic bonding increases, reach a maximum value and then decreases, as the d electrons pair up and become less available for bonding.

„ Ionization energy of transition element is intermediate between those of s and p block elements. As we move from left to right in a transition metal series, the ionization enthalpy increases as expected.

„ The first transition metal Scandium exhibits only +3 oxidation state, but all other transition elements exhibit variable oxidation states by loosing electrons from (n-1)d orbital and ns orbital as the energy difference between them is very small.

„ In 3d series as we move from Ti to Zn, the standard reduction potential _E M_

value is approaching towards less negative value and copper has a positive

reduction potential. i.e., elemental copper is more stable than Cu2+.

„ Most of the compounds of transition elements are paramagnetic. Magnetic properties are related to the electronic configuration of atoms.

„ Many industrial processes use transition metals or their compounds as catalysts. Transition metal has energetically available d orbitals that can accept electrons from reactant molecule or metal can form bond with reactant molecule using its d electrons.

„ Transition metals form a number of interstitial compounds such as TiC, ZrH , Mn N etc1.92 4 .

„ Transition elements have a tendency to form coordination compounds with a species that has an ability to donate an electron pair to form a coordinate covalent bond.

„ In the inner transition elements there are two series of elements. 1) Lanthanoids ( previously called lanthanides) 2) Actinoids ( previously called actinides)

„ Lanthanoids have general electronic configuration \[Xe\] f d s4 5 61 14 0 1 2− −

„ The common oxidation state of lanthanoides is +3

„ As we move across 4f series, the atomic and ionic radii of lanthanoids show gradual decrease with increse in atomic number. This decrese in ionic size is called lanthanoid contraction.

„ The electronic configuration of actinoids is not definite. The general valence shell electronic configuration of 5f elements is represented as \[Rn\]5f 0-146d0-27s2.

„ Like lanthanoids, the most common state of actinoids is +3. In addition to that actinoids show variable oxidation states such as +2 , +3 , +4 ,+5,+6 and +7.
