**INTRODUCTION** Generally the metallic elements that have incompletely filled d or f sub shell in the

neutral or cationic state are called transition metals. This definition includes lanthanoides and actinides. However, IUPAC defines transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub shell or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub shell. They occupy the central position of the periodic table, between s and p block elements, and their properties are transitional between highly reactive metals of s block and elements of p block which are mostly non metals. Except group- 11 elements all transition metals are hard and have very high melting point.

Transition metals, iron and copper play an important role in the development of human civilization. Many other transition elements also have important applications such as tungsten in light bulb filaments, titanium in manufacturing artificial joints, molybdenum in boiler plants, platinum in catalysis etc. They also play vital role in living system, for example iron in hemoglobin, cobalt in vitamin B12 etc.,

In this unit we study the general trend in properties of d block elements with specific reference to 3d series, their characteristics, chemical reactivity, some important compounds KMnO4 and K2Cr2O7, we also discuss the f-block elements later in this unit.

## Position of d- block elements in the periodic table:
 We have already learnt the periodic classification of elements in XI std. the transition

metals occupy from group –3 to group-12 of the modern periodic table.

d- Block elements composed of 3d series (4th period) Scandium to Zinc ( 10 elements), 4d series ( 5th period) Yttrium to Cadmium ( 10 elements) and 5d series ( 6th period) Lanthanum, Haffinium to mercury. As we know that the group-12 elements Zinc, Cadmium and Mercury do not have partially filled d-orbital either in their elemental state or in their normal oxidation states. However they are treated as transition elements, because their properties are an extension of the properties of the respective transition elements. As per the IUPAC definition, the seventh period elements, starting from Ac, Rf to Cn also belong to transition metals. All of them are radioactive. Except Actinium; all the remaining elements are synthetically prepared and have very low half life periods.

## Electronic configuration:
 We have already learnt in XI STD to write the electronic configuration of the elements

using Aufbau principle, Hund’s rule etc. According to Aufbau principle, the electron first fills the 4s orbital before 3d orbital. Therefore filling of 3d orbital starts from Sc, its electronic configuration is \[Ar\]3d1 4s2 and the electrons of successive elements are progressively filled in 3d orbital and the filling of 3d orbital is complete in Zinc, whose electronic configuration is \[Ar\] 3d10 4s2. However, there are two exceptions in the above mentioned progressive filling of 3d orbitals; if there is a chance of acquiring half filled or fully filled 3d sub shell, it is given priority as they are the stable configuration, for example Cr and Cu.

The electronic configurations of Cr and Cu are \[Ar\] 3d5 4s1 and \[Ar\] 3d10 4s1 respectively. The extra stability of half filled and fully filled d orbitals, as already explained in XI STD, is due to symmetrical distribution of electrons and exchange energy.

**Note: The extra stability due to symmetrical distribution can also be visualized as follows.** When the d orbitals are considered together, they will constitute a sphere. So the half filled and fully filled configuration leads to complete symmetrical distribution of electron density. On the other hand, an unsymmetrical distribution of electron density as in the case of partially filled configuration will result in building up of a potential difference. To decrease this and to achieve a tension free state with lower energy, a symmetrical distribution is preferred.

With these two exceptions and minor variation in certain individual cases, the general electronic configuration of d- block elements can be written as \[ \]Noble gas n d ns−( ) − −1 1 10 1 2, Here, n = 4 to 7 . In periods 6 and 7, (except La and Ac) the configuration includes

(_n f_−( )2 orbital ; \[ \]Noble gas n 2 f n d ns14−( ) −( ) − −1 1 10 1 2 .

## General trend in properties: 4.3.1 Metallic behavior:


All the transition elements are metals. Similar to all metals the transition metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Unlike the metals of Group-1 and group-2, all the transition metals except group 11 elements are hard. Of all the known elements, silver has the highest electrical conductivity at room temperature.

Most of the transition elements are hexagonal close packed, cubic close packed or body centrered cubic which are the characteristics of true metals.

**Figure 4.2 lattice structures of 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals**

As we move from left to right along the transition metal series, melting point first increases as the number of unpaired d electrons available for metallic bonding increases, reach a maximum value and then decreases, as the d electrons pair up and become less available for bonding.

For example, in the first series the melting point increases from Scandium (m.pt 1814K) to a maximum of 2183 K for vanadium, which is close to 2180K for chromium. However, manganese in 3d series and Tc in 4d series have low melting point. The maximum melting point at about the middle of transition metal series indicates that d5 configuration is favorable for strong interatomic attraction. The following figure shows the trends in melting points of transition elements.

### Variation of atomic and ionic size:


It is generally expected a steady decrease in atomic radius along a period as the nuclear charge increases and the extra electrons are added to the same sub shell. But for the 3d transition elements, the expected decrease in atomic radius is observed from Sc to V , thereafter up to Cu the atomic radius nearly remains the same. As we move from Sc toZn in 3d series the extra electrons are added to the 3d orbitals, the added 3d electrons only partially shield the increased nuclear charge and hence the effective nuclear charge increases slightly. However, the extra electrons added to the 3d sub shell strongly repel the 4s electrons and these two forces are operated in opposite direction and as they tend to balance each other, it leads to constancy in atomic radii.

At the end of the series, d – orbitals of Zinc contain 10 electrons in which the repulsive interaction between the electrons is more than the effective nuclear charge and hence, the orbitals slightly expand and atomic radius slightly increases.

Generally as we move down a group atomic radius increases, the same trend is expected in d block elements also. As the electrons are added to the 4d sub shell, the atomic radii of the 4d elements are higher than the corresponding elements of the 3d series. However there is an unexpected observation in the atomic radius of 5d

elements which have nearly same atomic radius as that of corresponding 4d elements. Th is is due to lanthanoide contraction which is to be discussed later in this unit under inner transition elements.

### Ionization enthalpy:


Ionization energy of transition element is intermediate between those of s and p block elements. As we move from left to right in a transition metal series, the ionization enthalpy increases as expected. This is due to increase in nuclear charge corresponding to the filling of d electrons. The following figure show the trends in ionisation enthalpy of transition elements.

Th e increase in fi rst ionisation enthalpy with increase in atomic number along a particular series is not regular. Th e added electron enters (n-1)d orbital and the inner electrons act as a shield and decrease the eff ect of nuclear charge on valence ns electrons. Th erefore, it leads to variation in the ionization energy values.

Th e ionisation enthalpy values can be used to predict the thermodynamic stability of their compounds. Let us compare the ionisation energy required to form Ni2+ and Pt2+ ions.

For Nickel, IE + IE = 737 + 1753

\= 2490 kJmol 1 2 ( )

For Platinum, IE + IE = 864 + 1791 = 2655 kJmol

Since, the energy required to form Ni2+ is less than that of Pt2+, Ni(II) compounds are thermodynamically more stable than Pt(II) compounds.

### Oxidation state:


The first transition metal Scandium exhibits only +3 oxidation state, but all other transition elements exhibit variable oxidation states by loosing electrons from (n-1)d orbital and ns orbital as the energy difference between them is very small. Let us consider the 3d series; the following table summarizes the oxidation states of the 3d series elements.

Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu +7

+6 +6 +6 +5 +5 +5

+4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3

+2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +1

At the beginning of the series, +3 oxidation state is stable but towards the end +2 oxidation state becomes stable.

The number of oxidation states increases with the number of electrons available, and it decreases as the number of paired electrons increases. Hence, the first and last elements show less number of oxidation states and the middle elements with more number of oxidation states. For example, the first element Sc has only one oxidation state +3; the middle element Mn has six different oxidation states from +2 to +7. The last element Cu shows +1 and +2 oxidation states only.

The relative stability of different oxidation states of 3d metals is correlated with the extra stability of half filled and fully filled electronic configurations. Example: Mn 3d2+ 5( ) is more stable than Mn 3d4+ 3( )

The oxidation states of 4d and 5d metals vary from +3 for Y and La to +8 for Ru and Os. The highest oxidation state of 4d and 5d elements are found in their compounds with the higher electronegative elements like O, F and Cl. for example: RuO4, OsO4 and WCl6. Generally in going down a group, a stability of the higher oxidation state increases while that of lower oxidation state decreases.It is evident from the Frost diagram (ΔG0 vs oxidation number) as shown below,For titanium,vanadium and chromium, the most thermodynamically stable oxidation state is +3. For iron, the stabilities of +3 and +2 oxidation states are similar.Copper

**Evaluate yourself:**

Why iron is more stable in +3 oxidation state than in +2 and the reverse is true for Manganese?

### Standard electrode potentials of transition metals


Redox reactions involve transfer of electrons from one reactant to another. Such reactions are always coupled, which means that when one substance is oxidised, another must be reduced. The substance which is oxidised is a reducing agent and the one which is reduced is an oxidizing agent. The oxidizing and reducing power of an element is measured in terms of the standard electrode potentials.

Standard electrode potential is the value of the standard emf of a cell in which molecular hydrogen under standard pressure ( 1atm) and temperature (273K) is oxidised to solvated protons at the electrode.

If the standard electrode potential (E0), of a metal is large and negative, the metal is a powerful reducing agent, because it loses electrons easily. Standard electrode potentials (reduction potential) of few first transition metals are given in the following table.

value for manganese and zinc are more negative than the regular

Transition metals in their high oxidation states tend to be oxidizing . For example,

Fe3+ is moderately a strong oxidant, and it oxidises copper to Cu2+ ions. The feasibility of the

The negative values for titanium, vanadium and chromium indicate that the higher oxidation state is preferred. If we want to reduce such a stable Cr3+ ion, strong reducing agent which has high negative value for reduction potential like metallic zinc E 0.76 V0 = −( ) is required.

\+ the reduction potential is 0.77V, and this low value indicates that both Fe3+ and Fe2+ can

exist under normal conditions. The drop from Mn to Fe is due to the electronic structure of the ions

concerned.Mn3+ has a 3d4 configuration while that of Mn2+ is 3d5. The extra stability associated with a

half filled d sub shell makes the reduction of Mn3+ very feasible (E0 = +1.51V).

the electron is spinning around its own axis, in addition to its orbital motion around the nucleus. Due to these motions, a tiny magnetic field is generated and it is measured in terms of magnetic moment. On the basis of magnetic properties, materials can be broadly classified as (i) paramagnetic materials (ii) diamagnetic materials, besides these there are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials.

Materials with no elementary magnetic dipoles are diamagnetic, in other words a species with all paired electrons exhibits diamagnetism. This kind of materials are repelled by the magnetic field because the presence of external magnetic field, a magnetic induction is introduced to the material which generates weak magnetic field that oppose the applied field.

Paramagnetic solids having unpaired electrons possess magnetic dipoles which are isolated from one another. In the absence of external magnetic field, the dipoles are arranged at random and hence the solid shows no net magnetism. But in the presence of magnetic field, the dipoles are aligned parallel to the direction of the applied field and therefore, they are attracted by an external magnetic field.

Ferromagnetic materials have domain structure and in each domain the magnetic dipoles are arranged. But the spin dipoles of the adjacent domains are randomly oriented. Some transition elements or ions with unpaired d electrons show ferromagnetism.

3d transition metal ions in paramagnetic solids often have a magnetic dipole moments corresponding to the electron spin contribution only. The orbital moment L is said to be quenched. So the magnetic moment of the ion is given by

µ µ= +g S S B( )1

Where S is the total spin quantum number of the unpaired electrons and is µ µ= +g S S B( )1 Bohr Magneton.

For an ion with n unpaired electrons _S n_\= 2

and for an electron g=2

Therefore the spin only magnetic moment is given by

### Catalytic properties


The chemical industries manufacture a number of products such as polymers, flavours, drugs etc., Most of the manufacturing processes have adverse effect on the environment so there is an interest for eco friendly alternatives. In this context, catalyst based manufacturing processes are advantageous, as they require low energy, minimize waste production and enhance the conversion of reactants to products.

Many industrial processes use transition metals or their compounds as catalysts. Transition metal has energetically available d orbitals that can accept electrons from reactant molecule or metal can form bond with reactant molecule using its d electrons. For example, in the catalytic hydrogenation of an alkene, the alkene bonds to an active site by using its π electrons with an empty d orbital of the catalyst.

The σ bond in the hydrogen molecule breaks, and each hydrogen atom forms a bond with a d electron on an atom in the catalyst. The two hydrogen atoms then bond with the partially broken π -bond in the alkene to form an alkane.

### Alloy formation


An alloy is formed by blending a metal with one or more other elements. The elements may be metals or non-metals or both. The bulk metal is named as solvent, and the other elements in smaller portions are called solute. According to Hume-Rothery rule to form a substitute alloy the difference between the atomic radii of solvent and solute is less than 15%. Both the solvent and solute must have the same crystal structure and valence and their electro negativity difference must be close to zero. Transition metals satisfying these mentioned conditions form a number of alloys among themselves, since their atomic sizes are similar and one metal atom can be easily replaced by another metal atom from its crystal lattice to form an alloy. The alloys so formed are hard and often have high melting points. Examples: Ferrous alloys, gold – copper alloy, chrome alloys etc.,

### Formation of interstitial compounds


An interstitial compound or alloy is a compound that is formed when small atoms like hydrogen, boron, carbon or nitrogen are trapped in the interstitial holes in a metal lattice. They are usually non-stoichiometric compounds.Transition metals form a number of interstitial compounds such as TiC, ZrH , Mn N etc1.92 4 . The elements that occupy the metal lattice provide them new properties.

(i) They are hard and show electrical and thermal conductivity

(ii) They have high melting points higher than those of pure metals

(iii) Transition metal hydrides are used as powerful reducing agents

(iv) Metallic carbides are chemically inert.

### Formation of complexes


Transition elements have a tendency to form coordination compounds with a species that has an ability to donate an electron pair to form a coordinate covalent bond. Transition metal ions are small and highly charged and they have vacant low energy orbitals to accept an electron pair donated by other groups. Due to these properties, transition metals form large number of complexes. Examples: \[Fe(CN)6\]

4- , \[Co(NH3)6\] 3+ , etc..

The chemistry of coordination compound is discussed in unit 5.

## important compound of Transition elements Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals


Generally, transition metal oxides are formed by the reaction of transition metals with molecular oxygen at high temperatures. Except the first member of 3d series, Scandium, all other transition elements form ionic metal oxides. The oxidation number of metal in metal oxides ranges from +2 to +7. As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character decreases, for example, Mn2O7 is covalent. Mostly higher oxides are acidic in nature, Mn2O7 dissolves in water to give permanganic acid (HMnO4 ) , similarly CrO3 gives chromic acid (H2CrO4) and dichromic acid (H2Cr2O7). Generally lower oxides may be amphoteric or basic, for example, Chromium (III) oxide - Cr2O3, is amphoteric and Chromium(II) oxide, CrO, is basic in nature.

**Potassium dichromate K2Cr2O7 Preparation:** Potassium dichromate is prepared from chromate ore. The ore is concentrated by gravity separation. It is then mixed with excess sodium carbonate and lime and roasted in a reverbratory furnace.

The roasted mass is treated with water to separate soluble sodium chromate from insoluble iron oxide. The yellow solution of sodium chromate is treated with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts sodium chromate into sodium dichromate.

Structures of these ions are shown in the fi gure.

**Bayer’s reagent:**

Cold dilute alkaline KMnO4 is known as Bayer’s reagent. It is used to oxidise alkenes into diols. For example, ethylene can be converted into ethylene glycol and this reaction is used as a test for unsaturation.

c) In acid medium:

In the presence of dilute sulphuric acid, potassium permanganate acts as a very strong oxidising agent. Permanganate ion is converted into Mn2+ ion.

**Uses of potassium permanganate:**

Some important uses of potassium permanganate are listed below.

1\. It is used as a strong oxidizing agent.

2\. It is used for the treatment of various skin infections and fungal infections of the foot.

3\. It used in water treatment industries to remove iron and hydrogen sulphide from well water.

4\. It is used as Bayer’s reagent for detecting unsaturation in an organic compound.

5\. It is used in quantitative analysis for the estimation of ferrous salts, oxalates, hydrogen peroxide and iodides.

**Note** HCl cannot be used for making the medium acidic since it reacts with KMnO4 as follows.

HNO3 also cannot be used since it is good oxidising agent and reacts with reducing agents in the reaction.

However,H2SO4 is found to be most suitable since it does not react with potassium permanganate.

**f-block elements – Inner transition elements**

In the inner transition elements there are two series of elements.

1) Lanthanoids ( previously called lanthanides)

2) Actinoids ( previously called actinides)

Lanthanoid series consists of fourteen elements from Cerium (58Ce) to Lutetium (71Lu) following Lanthanum (57La).These elements are characterised by the preferential filling of 4f orbitals, Similarly actinoids consists of 14 elements from Thorium (90Th) to Lawrencium (103Lr) following Actinium (89Ac).These elements are characterised by the preferential filling of 5f orbital.

**The position of Lanthanoids in the periodic table**

The actual position of Lanthanoids in the periodic table is at group number 3 and period

number 6.However, in the sixth period after lanthanum, the electrons are preferentially filled in inner 4f sub shell and these fourteen elements following lanthanum show similar chemical properties. Therefore these elements are grouped together and placed at the bottom of the periodic table. This position can be justified as follows.

1\. Lanthanoids have general electronic configuration \[Xe\] f d s4 5 61 14 0 1 2− −

2\. The common oxidation state of lanthanoides is +3

3\. All these elements have similar physical and chemical properties.

Similarly the fourteen elements following actinium resemble in their physical and chemical properties. If we place these elements after Lanthanum in the periodic table below 4d series, the properties of the elements belongs to a group would be different and it would affect the proper structure of the periodic table. Hence a separate position is provided to the inner transition elements as shown in the figure.

**Electronic configuration of Lanthanoids:**

We know that the electrons are filled in different orbitals in the order of their increasing energy in accordance with Aufbau principle. As per this rule after filling 5s,5p and 6s and 4f level begin to fill from lanthanum, and hence the expected electronic configuration of Lanthanum(La) is \[Xe\] f d s4 5 61 0 2 but the actual electronic configuration of Lanthanum is

**Oxidation state of lanthanoids:**

The common oxidation state of lanthanoids is +3. In addition to that some of the lanthanoids also show either +2 or +4 oxidation states.

Gd3+ and Lu3+ ions have extra stability, it is due to the fact that they have exactly half filled and completely filled f-orbitals respectively.their electronic c onfigurations are

Similarly Cerium and terbium attain 4f0 and 4f7 configurations respectively in the +4 oxidation states. Eu2+ and Yb2+ ions have exactly half filled and completely filled f orbitals respectively.

The stability of different oxidation states has an impact on the properties of these elements. the following table shows the different oxidation states of lanthanoids.

**Atomic and ionic radii:**

As we move across 4f series, the atomic and ionic radii of lanthanoids show gradual decrease with increse in atomic number. This decrese in ionic size is called lanthanoid contraction.

**Cause of lanthanoid contraction:**

As we move from one element to another in 4f series ( Ce to Lu) the nuclear charge increases by one unit and an additional electron is added into the same inner 4f sub shell. We know that 4f sub shell have a diffused shapes and therefore the shielding effect of 4f elelctrons relatively poor.hence, with increase of nuclear charge, the valence shell is pulled slightly towards nucleus. As a result, the effetive nuclear charge experienced by the 4f elelctorns increases and the size of Ln3+ ions decreases. Lanthanoid contraction of various lanthanoids is shown in the graph

**Consequences of lanthanoid contraction: 1. Basicity differences**

As we from Ce3+ to Lu3+ , the basic character of Ln3+ ions decrease. Due to the decrease in the size of Ln3+ ions, the ionic character of Ln OH− bond decreases (covalent character increases) which results in the decrease in the basicity. **2\. Similarities among lanthanoids:**

In the complete f - series only 10 pm decrease in atomic radii and 20 pm decrease in ionic radii is observed. because of this very small change in radii of lanthanoids, their chemical properties are quite similar.

**Actinoids:**

The fourteen elements following actinium ,i.e., from thorium (Th) to lawrentium (Lr) are called actinoids. Unlike the lanthanoids, all the actinoids are radioactive and most of them have short half lives. Only thorium and uranium(U) occur in significant amount in nature and a trace amounts of Plutonium(Pu) is also found in Uranium ores.Neptunium(Np) and successive heavier elements are produced synthetically by the artificial transformation of naturally occuring elements by nuclear reactions.

Similar to lanthanoids, they are placed at the bottom of the periodic table. **Electronic configuration:**

The electronic configuration of actinoids is not definite. The general valence shell electronic configuration of 5f elements is represented as \[Rn\]5f 0-146d0-27s2. The following table show the electronic configuration of actinoids.

**Summary**

„ IUPAC defines transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub shell or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub shell. They occupy the central position of the periodic table, between s and p block elements,

„ d- Block elements composed of 3d series (4th period) Scandium to Zinc ( 10 elements), 4d series ( 5th period) Yttrium to Cadmium ( 10 elements) and 5d series ( 6th period) Lanthanum, Haffinium to mercury.

„ the general electronic configuration of d- block elements can be written as \[ \]Noble gas n d ns−( ) − −1 1 10 1 2, Here, n = 4 to 7 . In periods 6 and 7, the configuration includes (_n f_−( )2 orbital ; \[ \]Noble gas n 2 f n d ns14−( ) −( ) − −1 1 10 1 2 .

„ All the transition elements are metals. Similar to all metals the transition metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Unlike the metals of Group-1 and group-2, all the transition metals except group 11 elements are hard.

„ As we move from left to right along the transition metal series, melting point first increases as the number of unpaired d electrons available for metallic bonding increases, reach a maximum value and then decreases, as the d electrons pair up and become less available for bonding.

„ Ionization energy of transition element is intermediate between those of s and p block elements. As we move from left to right in a transition metal series, the ionization enthalpy increases as expected.

„ The first transition metal Scandium exhibits only +3 oxidation state, but all other transition elements exhibit variable oxidation states by loosing electrons from (n-1)d orbital and ns orbital as the energy difference between them is very small.

„ In 3d series as we move from Ti to Zn, the standard reduction potential _E M_

_M_

value is approaching towards less negative value and copper has a positive

reduction potential. i.e., elemental copper is more stable than Cu2+.

„ Most of the compounds of transition elements are paramagnetic. Magnetic properties are related to the electronic configuration of atoms.

„ Many industrial processes use transition metals or their compounds as catalysts. Transition metal has energetically available d orbitals that can accept electrons from reactant molecule or metal can form bond with reactant molecule using its d electrons.

„ Transition metals form a number of interstitial compounds such as TiC, ZrH , Mn N etc1.92 4 .

„ Transition elements have a tendency to form coordination compounds with a species that has an ability to donate an electron pair to form a coordinate covalent bond.

„ In the inner transition elements there are two series of elements. 1) Lanthanoids ( previously called lanthanides) 2) Actinoids ( previously called actinides)

„ Lanthanoids have general electronic configuration \[Xe\] f d s4 5 61 14 0 1 2− −

„ The common oxidation state of lanthanoides is +3

„ As we move across 4f series, the atomic and ionic radii of lanthanoids show gradual decrease with increse in atomic number. This decrese in ionic size is called lanthanoid contraction.

„ The electronic configuration of actinoids is not definite. The general valence shell electronic configuration of 5f elements is represented as \[Rn\]5f 0-146d0-27s2.

„ Like lanthanoids, the most common state of actinoids is +3. In addition to that actinoids show variable oxidation states such as +2 , +3 , +4 ,+5,+6 and +7.
