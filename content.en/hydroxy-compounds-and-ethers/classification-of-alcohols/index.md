## Classification of alcohols:
 Alcohols can be classified based on the number of hydroxyl groups and the nature of the carbon to which the functional group (–OH) is attached.

<!-- Alcohols

(Monohydric alcohols) containing only one - OH group CH3 - CH2 - OH(ethanol)

(Polyhydric alcohols) containing more than one -OH group

\-OH group attached to sp3 hybridised carbon

\-OH group attached to sp2hybridised carbon eg: vinyl alcohol CH2 = CH - OH

ethenol

–OH group attached to alkyl group
