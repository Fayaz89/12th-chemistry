We have already learnt about naming the organic compounds according to IUPAC

guidelines in XI standard. Let us recall the basic rules to name the alcohols.

1. Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms (root word) containing the functional group ( -OH ). 
 
2. Number the carbon atoms in the chain so that the carbon bearing the -OH group has the lowest possible number. 
 
3. Name the substituent (if any) 
 
4. Write the name of the alcohol as below.

Prefix + Root word + Primary suffix + Secondary suffix (substituents) (longest chain) (Saturation /unsaturation) (ol)

**The following table illustrates the IUPAC nomenclature of alcohols.**

**Structure of the functional group of alcohol.** 
 
 The structure of -O-H group which is attached to a sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised carbon is similar to the structure of -O-H group attached to a hydrogen in water. i.e., ‘V’ shaped. In such alcohols, one of the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised orbital of

![sp3 Hybrid Carbon](107-sp3-hybridised-carbon.png)







oxygen linearly overlap with the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised orbital of carbon to form a C-O , 'σ ' bond and another sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised orbital linearly overlap with 1s orbital of hydrogen to form a O-H 'σ ' bond. The remaining two sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised orbitals of oxygen are occupied by two lone pairs of electrons. Due to the lone pair – lone pair repulsion, the C-O-H bond angle in methanol is reduced to 108 9. ° from the regular tetrahedral bond angle of 109 5. ° .

**Preparation of alcohols:** We have already learnt that the nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl halides with

dilute alkali, conversion of alkenes to alcohols by hydration and the preparation of alcohols using Grignard reagent in XI standard. These reactions are summarised below.
1. **From Alkyl halides:** Alkyl halides on heating with dilute aqueous NaOH gives alcohols. Primary alkyl halides undergo substitution by SN<sup>2</sup> reaction. Secondary and tertiary alkyl halides usually undergo nucleophilic substitution by SN<sup>1</sup> mechanism.

    >$\ce{R-X + NaOH(aq) ->[\Delta] R-OH + NaX}$ 
    
    >>If R =t-butyl, the reaction proceeds through the formation of t-butyl carbocation

2. **From alkenes:** Addition of water across the double bond of an alkene in presence of concentrated sulphuric acid gives alcohols. This addition reaction follows Markownikoff ’s rule.


    **Example:** 

    >$\ce{CH3-CH=CH2 + H2O ->[{Conc. H2SO4}] CH-CH(OH)-CH}$

3. **From Grignard reagent:** Nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagent to aldehydes/ketones in presence of dry ether followed by the acid hydrolysis gives alcohols. Formaldehyde gives primary alcohol and other aldehydes give secondary alcohols. Ketones give tertiary alcohols.

4. **Hydroboration:**

    Diborane reacts with an alkene to form trialkyl borane which on treatment with H O2 2 in presence of NaOH gives an alcohol. (Refer reactions of diborane) The overall reaction is hydration of an alkene. This reaction yields an anti-Markownikoff 's product.

5. **Reduction of carbonyl compounds:**

    Reduction of aldehydes/ketones with LiAlH4 in the presence of solvents like THF (Tetrahydrofuran) followed by hydrolysis gives alcohols. Unlike other reducing agents such as Raney Ni, Na-Hg/H O,2 the lithium aluminium hydride does not reduce the carbon**–**carbon double bond present in unsaturated carbonyl compound and hence it is a best reagent to prepare unsaturated alcohols.

When two or more functional groups are present in a molecule a less vigorous sodium borohydride is used as a reducing agent to reduce the more reactive group. For example, if a compound contains both carbonyl and carboxyl group, it preferentially reduces the carbonyl group.

**Methods to differentiate primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols.** The following tests are used to distinguish between 1° , 2° and 3°  alcohols.

**a) Lucas test:** When alcohols are treated with Lucas agent (a mixture of concentrated HCl and anhydrous

ZnCl<sub>2</sub> ) at room temperature, tertiary alcohols react immediately to form a turbidity due to the formation of alkyl chloride which is insoluble in the medium. Secondary alcohols react within 10 minutes to form a turbidity of alkyl chloride where primary alcohols do not react at room temperature.

**b) Victor Meyer’s test:**

This test is based on the behaviour of the different nitro alkanes formed by the three types of alcohols with nitrous acid and it consists of the following steps.

i) Alcohols are converted into alkyl iodide by treating it with I<sub>2</sub>/P .

ii) Alkyl iodide so formed is then treated with AgNO<sub>2</sub> to form nitro alkanes.

iii) Nitro alkanes are finally treated with HNO<sub>2</sub> (mixture of NaNO HCl<sub>2</sub> / ) and the resultant solution is made alkaline with KOH.

**Result:**

• Primary alcohol gives red colour • Secondary alcohol gives blue colour.

• No colouration will be observed in case of tertiary alcohol.

**Properties of alcohols Physical properties**

1. Lower alcohols are colourless liquids and the higher members are waxy solids.

2. They have higher boiling points than the corresponding other organic compounds such as alkanes, aldehydes, ethers etc., this is due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding present in alcohols.

3. Among isomeric alcohols primary alcohols have higher boiling point and the tertiary alcohols have lower boiling points.

**Chemical properties of alcohols Nucleophilic substitution reactions of alcohols**

Alcohol has a strong basic leaving group (OH<sup>-</sup>). So, –OH group is first converted into



OH<sub>2</sub> group by adding an acid. The 

OH<sub>2</sub> group in the protonated alcohol can be easily

displaced by a nucleophile such as Br<sup>-</sup> to give alkyl halides. **Example**: Alcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction with hydro halic acids to form

alkyl halides. In case of tertiary alcohols heating is required.

**2\. Elimination reactions of alcohols** When alcohols are heated with a suitable dehydrating agents like sulphuric acid, the H

and OH present in the adjacent carbons of alcohols are lost, and it results in the formation of a carbon – carbon double bond. Phosphoric acid, anhydrous ZnCl2 , alumina etc., can also be used as dehydrating agents.

**Example**

**Saytzeff ’s rule** During intramolecular dehydration, if there is a possibility to form a carbon – carbon

double bond at different locations, the preferred location is the one that gives the more (highly) substituted alkene i.e., the stable alkene.

For example, the dehydration of 3,3 – dimethyl – 2- butanol gives a mixture of alkenes. The secondary carbocation formed in this reaction undergoes rearrangement to form a more stable tertiary carbocation.

**Oxidation of alcohols** The important reactions of alcohols are their oxidation to give carbonyl compounds.

The commonly used oxidising agent is acidified sodiumdichromate. Oxidation of primary alcohols give an aldehyde which on further oxidation gives the carboxylic acids. To stop the oxidation reaction at the aldehyde / ketone stage, pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is used as an oxidising agent.

**Biological oxidation**

The fermentation of the food consumed by an animal produces alcohol. To detoxify the alcohol, the liver produces an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) present in the animals act as an oxidising agent and ADH catalyses the oxidation of toxic alcohols into non-toxic aldehyde.

**Reactions of Glycol**

Ethylene glycol contains two primary alcoholic groups and it exhibits the usual reactions of hydroxyl group. Like other primary alcohols, it reacts with metallic sodium to form monosodium glycolate and disodium glycolate. The hydroxyl groups can be converted to the halide groups by treating glycol with halic acid (or with PCl / PCl / SOCl5 3 2 . )

When ethylene glycol is treated with HI or P/I2, 1,2 – diiodoethane is first formed which decomposes to give ethene.

**Acidity of alcohols**

According to Bronsted theory, an acid is defined as a proton donor and the acid strength is the tendency to give up a proton. Alcohols are weakly acidic and their acidity is comparable with water. Except methanol, all other alcohols are weaker acid than water. The K<sub>a</sub> value for water is 1.8 * 10<sup>-16</sup>>  − where as for alcohols, the K<sub>a</sub> value in the order 10<sup>-18</sup> to 10<sup>-16</sup> .

Alcohols react with active metals such as sodium, aluminium etc… to form the corresponding alkoxides with the liberation of hydrogen gas and similar reaction to give alkoxide is not observed in the reaction of alcohol with NaOH.

>$\ce{2CH-OH + 2Na -> 2C2H5ONa + H2↑}$

<!-- 2C H - OH + 2Na 2C H ONa + H 2 5 2 5 2

→ ↑ -->

The above reaction explains the acidic nature of alcohols.


**Comparison of acidity of 1° , 2° and 3°  alcohols**

The acidic nature of the alcohol is due to the polar nature of O –H bond. When an electron withdrawing -I groups such as -Cl, - F etc… is attached to the carbon bearing the OH group, it withdraws the electron density towards itself and thereby facilitating the proton donation. In contrast, the electron releasing group such as alkyl group increases the electron density on oxygen and decreases the polar nature of O – H bond, Hence it results in the decrease in acidity. on moving from primary to secondary and tertiary alcohols, the number of alkyl groups which attached to the carbon bearing -OH group increases, which results in the following order of acidity.

**1°  alcohol > 2°  alcohol > 3°  alcohol**

**Acidity of Phenol** Phenol is more acidic than aliphatic alcohols. Unlike alcohols it reacts with bases like

sodium hydroxide to form sodium phenoxide. This explains the acidic behaviour of phenol.let us consider the aqueous solution of phenol in which the following equilibrium exists.

$\ce{C6H5OH + H.OH -> C6H5O- + H3O+}$


<!-- C6H5 OH + H.OH C6H5 O + H3O -->

K a value for the above equilibrium is 1×10 at 25 C

\-10 o . This Ka value indicates that it is more acidic than aliphatic alcohols. This increased acidic behaviour can be explained on the basis of the stability of phenoxide ion. We have already learnt in XI standard that the phenoxide is more stabilised by resonance than phenol.

In substituted phenols, the electron withdrawing groups such as -NO<sub>2</sub> ,-Cl 

enhances the acidic nature of phenol especially when they are present at ortho and para positions. In such cases,there is a possibility for the extended delocalisation of negative charge on the phenoxide ion. On the other hand the alkyl substitued phenols show a decreased acidity due to the electron releasing +I effect of alkyl group.

**Reactions of benzene ring: Electrophilic aromatic substitution:**

We have already learnt in XI standard that the groups like -OH, -NH2, etc., which when directly attached to the benzene ring, activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution reaction and direct the incoming electrophile to occupy either the ortho or para position.

**Common electrophilic aromatic substitutions are as follows:**

**Structure of functional group**

The structure of ethereal oxygen which is attached to two alkyl groups is similar to the structure of -O-H group of alcohol. The oxygen atom is sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized. Two sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized orbitals of oxygen linearly overlap with two sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals of the carbon which are directly attached to the oxygen forming two C-O 'σ ' bonds. The C-O-C bond angle is slightly greater than the tetrahedral bond angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two bulkier alkyl groups.

**Preparation of ethers: 1. Inter molecular dehydration of alcohol.**

We have already learnt that when ethanol is treated with con.H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 443K, elimination takes place to form ethene. If the same reaction is carried out at 413K, substitution competes over elimination to form ethers.

**Mechanism:**

This method is useful for the preparation of simple ethers and not suitable for preparing mixed ethers. If a mixture of two different alcohols is used, mixture of different ethers will be formed and they are difficult to separate.

**2\. Williamsons synthesis:** When an alkyl halide is heated with an alcoholic solution of sodium alkoxide, the

corresponding ethers are obtained. The reaction involves SN2 mechanism.

We know that primary alkyl halides are more susceptible for SN2 reaction. Hence for the preparation of mixed ether having primary and tertiary alkyl group, primary alkyl halide and tertiary alkoxide are used. On the other hand, if we use tertiary alkyl halide and primary alkoxide, elimination dominates and succeeds over substitution to form an an alkene.

**Physical Properties:** Ethers are polar in nature. The dipolemoment of ether is the vector sum of two polar

C-O bonds with significant contribution from two lone pairs of electrons. For example, the dipole moment of diethyl ether is 1.18D. Boiling point of ethers are slightly higher than that of alkanes and lower than that of alcohols of comparable masses.
