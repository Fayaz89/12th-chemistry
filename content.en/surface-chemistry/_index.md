Irving Langmuir was an American
Chemist and Physicist. He was
awarded Nobel Prize in the year
1932 in Chemistry for his works
in Surface Chemistry. He outlined
the concentric theory of atomic
structure. He invented the gas filled
incandescent lamp and hydrogen
welding technique. The Langmuir
Laboratory for Atmospheric
Research near Socorro, New Mexico
was named in his honor. Langmuir
and Tonks discovered electron
density waves in plasmas that are
now known as Langmuir waves.

Surface chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the processes occurring at interfaces between phases for example, solid and liquid, solid and gas and liquid and liquid. This topic is of immense importance to our everyday life and to numerous industries, from materials and paints to medicine and biotechnology. Surfaces play a key role in heterogeneous catalysis, formation and stability of colloids and electrode reactions. Surfaces of solids are inherently different from their bulk portion. The bonding between the atoms at the mere surface is different from that in the bulk. Hydrogen that exists in the interstellar space are formed on the surfaces of grains and dust particles. Mosquitoes and other small insects can walk on the surface of water but they will drown into the water when soaps are added in the neighbourhood. We are fascinated by the spherical shape of water droplets and mercury droplets. We are also impressed by the non-sticky wings of butterfly and leaves of plants. Blue colour of the sky and red colour of the sunset strongly attract us. In all the above only the surface of matter is important. Many of creams, lotions and other personal care products are complex emulsions. Food companies are interested in developing healthy, tasty and longlasting food products. All these are based on the principles of colloids and surface chemistry. So, surface Chemistry is an exciting topic to learn.
