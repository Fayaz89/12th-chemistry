**Irving Langmuir**

Irving Langmuir was an American

Chemist and Physicist. He was

awarded Nobel Prize in the year

1932 in Chemistry for his works

in Surface Chemistry. He outlined

the concentric theory of atomic

structure. He invented the gas fi lled

incandescent lamp and hydrogen

welding technique. Th e Langmuir

Laboratory for Atmospheric

Research near Socorro, New Mexico

was named in his honor. Langmuir

and Tonks discovered electron

density waves in plasmas that are

now known as Langmuir waves.

**INTRODUCTION**

Surface chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the processes occurring at interfaces between phases for example, solid and liquid, solid and gas and liquid and liquid. This topic is of immense importance to our everyday life and to numerous industries, from materials and paints to medicine and biotechnology. Surfaces play a key role in heterogeneous catalysis, formation and stability of colloids and electrode reactions. Surfaces of solids are inherently different from their bulk portion. The bonding between the atoms at the mere surface is different from that in the bulk. Hydrogen that exists in the interstellar space are formed on the surfaces of grains and dust particles. Mosquitoes and other small insects can walk on the surface of water but they will drown into the water when soaps are added in the neighbourhood. We are fascinated by the spherical shape of water droplets and mercury droplets. We are also impressed by the non-sticky wings of butterfly and leaves of plants. Blue colour of the sky and red colour of the sunset strongly attract us. In all the above only the surface of matter is important. Many of creams, lotions and other personal care products are complex emulsions. Food companies are interested in developing healthy, tasty and longlasting food products. All these are based on the principles of colloids and surface chemistry. So, surface Chemistry is an exciting topic to learn.
