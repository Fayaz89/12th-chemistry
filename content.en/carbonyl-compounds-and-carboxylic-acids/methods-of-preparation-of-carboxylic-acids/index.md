## Methods of Preparation of carboxylic acids
 Some important methods for the preparation of carboxylic acids are as follows :

**1\. From Primary alcohols and aldehydes**

Primary alcohols and aldehydes can easily be oxidised to the corresponding carboxylic acids with oxidising agents such as potassium permanganate (in acidic or alkaline medium), potassium dichromate (in acidic medium)

**Example**

(O)

H+/ K2Cr2O7

(O)Ethyl alcohol Acetaldehyde Acetic acid CH3CH2OH CH3CHO CH3COOH

**2\. Hydrolysis of Nitriles**

Nitriles yield carboxylic acids when subjected to hydrolysis with an acid or alkali.

**Example**

CH3 C N + 2H2O CH3COOH + NH3 H+

Methyl cyanide Acetic acid

**3\. Acidic hydrolysis of esters** Esters on hydrolysis with dilute mineral acids yield corresponding carboxylic acid

**Example**

CH3 C OC2H5 + H2O CH3 H+

Ethyl acetate Acetic acid

C OH + C2H5OH

Ethyl alcohol

O O

**4\. From Grignard reagent**

Grignard reagent reacts with carbon di oxide (dry ice) to form salts of carboxylic acid which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acid after acidification with mineral acid.

**Example**

C O + CH3MgBr

O dry ether

Formic acid cannot be prepared by Grignard reagent since the acid contains only one carbon atom **5\. Hydrolysis of acylhalides and anhydrides**

a) Acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give Carboxylic acids.

**Example**

CH3 C Cl + H2O

Acetyl chloride

O

CH3 C OH + HCl

O Acetic acid

b) Acid anhydride when hydrolysed with water give corresponding carboxylic acids.

CH3 C O C CH3 + H2O 2CH3 C OH

O O O Acetic anhydride Acetic Acid

2C6H5 C OH

O Benzoic acid

O C C6H5 + H2O

**6\. Oxidation of alkyl benzenes** Aromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of alkyl benzene with

chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium permanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to â€“COOH group irrespective of the length of the side chain.

**Example**

CH3

OH-/KMnO4

COOH

Toluene Benzoic acid

3(O)

**Evaluate yourself**

1) What happens when n-propyl benzene is oxidised using H+ / KMnO4?

2) How will you prepare benzoic acid using Grignard reagent.
