## Chemical properties of aldehydes and ketones A) Nucleophilic addition reactions


This reaction is the most common reactions of aldehydes and ketones. The carbonyl carbon carries a small degree of positive charge. Nucleophile such as CN

−can attack the carbonyl carbon and uses its lone pair to form a new carbon – nucleophile 'σ ' bond, at the same time two electrons from the carbon – oxygen double bond move to the most electronegative oxygen atom. This results in the formation of an alkoxide ion. In this process, the hybridisation of carbon changes from sp to sp2 3 .

In general, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones towards nucleophilic addition reactions due to +I and steric effect of alkyl groups.

**B) Oxidation of aldehydes and ketones**

**a) Oxidation of aldehydes** Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acid containing the same number of carbon

atom, as in parent aldehyde. The common oxidising agents are acidified K2Cr2O7, acidic or alkaline KMnO4 or chromic oxide.

**Example**

CH3 C = O

O

Acetaldehyde Aceticacid

H (o)

CH3 C OH

**b) Oxidation of ketone**

Ketones are not easily oxidised. Under drastic condition or with powerful oxidising agent like Con.HNO3, H+/KMnO4, H+/K2Cr2O7, cleavage of carbon-carbon bond takes place to give a mixture of carboxylic acids having less number of carbon atom than the parent ketone.

The oxidation of unsymmetrical ketones is governed by **Popoff ’s rule**. It states that during the oxidation of an unsymmetrical ketone, a (C–CO) bond is cleaved in such a way that the keto group stays with the smaller alkyl group.

**C) Reduction reactions**

**(i) Reduction to alcohols**

We have already learnt that aldehydes and ketones can be easily reduced to primary and secondary alcohols respectively. The most commonly used reducing agents are Lithium Aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), and Sodium borohydride (NaBH4).

**a) Aldehyde are reduced to primary alcohols. Example**

CH3 C + 2 (H)

O

LiAlH4

H

Acetaldehyde Ethylalcohol (1o)

CH3 CH2 OH

**b) Ketone are reduced to Secondary alcohols. Example**

CH3 C CH3 + 2(H)

O

NaBH4

Acetone OH

Isopropyl alcohol (2o)

CH3 3CH CH

The above reactions can also be carried out with hydrogen in the presence of metal catalyst like Pt, Pd, or Ni. LiAlH4 and NaBH4 do not reduce isolated carbon – carbon double bonds and double bond of benzene rings. In case of α, β unsaturated aldehyde and ketones, LiAlH4 reduces only C = O group leaving C = C bond as such.

**ii) Reduction to hydrocarbon**

The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to methylene group using suitable reducing agents to give hydrocarbons.

**E) Reaction involving alkylgroup**

**i)** **Aldol condensation**

The carbon attached to carbonyl carbon is called α - carbon and the hydrogen atom attached to α - carbon is called α - hydrogen.

In presence of dilute base NaOH, or KOH, two molecules of an aldehyde or ketone having α - hydrogen add together to give β- hydroxyl aldehyde (aldol) or β - hydroxyl ketone (ketol). The reaction is called aldol condensation reaction. The aldol or ketol readily loses water to give α,β – unsaturated compounds which are aldol condensation products.

**Mechanism**

The mechanism of aldol condensation of acetaldehyde takes place in three steps.

**Step 1 :**

The carbanion is formed as the α - hydrogen atom is removed as a proton by the base.

**ii) Crossed aldol condensation**

Aldol condensation can also take place between two different aldehydes or ketones or between one aldehyde and one ketone such an aldol condensation is called **crossed or mixed aldol condensation. This reaction is not very useful as the product is usually a mixture of all** possible condensation products and cannot be separated easily.

**F) Some important reactions of benzaldehyde**

**ii) Cannizaro reaction**

In the presence of concentrated aqueous or alcoholic alkali, aldehydes which do not have α - hydrogen atom undergo self oxidation and reduction (disproportionation) to give a mixture of alcohol and a salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is called Cannizaro reaction.

Benzaldehyde on treatment with concentrated NaOH (50%) gives benzyl alcohol and sodium benzoate.
