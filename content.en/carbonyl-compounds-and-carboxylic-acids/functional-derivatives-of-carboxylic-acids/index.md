## Functional derivatives of carboxylic acids
 Compounds such as acid chlorides, amides, esters etc., are called carboxylic acid

derivatives because they differ from a carboxylic acid only in the nature of the group or atom that has replaced the -OH group of carboxylic acid.

**Relative reactivity of Acid derivatives** The reactivity of the acid derivatives follows the order

R C Cl > R C O C R > R C OR' > R C NH2

OO OO O

The above order of reactivity can be explained in terms of i) Basicity of the leaving group ii) Resonance effect

**(i)** **Basicity of the leaving group** Weaker bases are good leaving groups. Hence acyl derivatives with weaker bases as

leaving groups (L) can easily rupture the bond and are more reactive. The correct order of the basicity of the leaving group is H2N : > : OR > RCOO : > : Cl Hence the reverse is the order of reactivity.

**(ii) Resonance effect** Lesser the electronegativity of the group, greater would

be the resonance stabilization as shown below. This effect makes the molecule more stable and reduces the

reactivity of the acyl compound. The order of electronegativity of the leaving groups follows the order – Cl > - OCOR > - OR > - NH2

Hence the order of reactivity of the acid derivatives with nucleophilic reagent follows the order

acid halide > acid anhydride > esters > acid amides

**12\. 14. 2. Acid Halides:**

**Methods of Preparation of acid chloride:**

Acid chlorides are prepared from carboxylic acid by treating it with anyone of the chlorinating agent such as SOCl2, PCl5, or PCl3

**1) By reaction with thionyl Chloride (SOCl2)**

C OH Cl

O O

CH3 C+ SOCl2 + HCl + SO2

Acetyl chloride

CH3

Acetic acid

This method is superior to others as the by products being gases escape leaving the acid chloride in the pure state.

**Physical properties:**

• They emit pale fumes of hydrogen chloride when exposed to air on account of their reaction with water vapour.

• They are insoluble in water but slowly begins to dissolve due to hydrolysis.

**Chemical properties:**

They react with weak nucleophiles such as water, alcohols, ammonia and amines to produce the corresponding acid, ester, amide or substituted amides.

**1) Hydrolysis.** Acyl halides undergo hydrolysis to form corresponding carboxylic acids

### Esters Methods of preparation 1. Esterification


We have already learnt that treatment of alcohols with carboxylic acids in presence of mineral acid gives esters. The reaction is carried to completion by using an excess of reactant or by removing the water from the reaction mixture. **2\. Alcoholysis of Acid chloride or Acid anhydrides**

ii) Treatment of acid chloride or acid anhydride with alcohol also gives esters **Physical Properties**

Esters are colour less liquids or solids with characteristic fruity smell. Flavours of some of the esters are given below.

**S.No Ester Flavour**

1 Amyl acetate Banana

2 Ethyl butyrate Pineapple

3 Octyl acetate Orange

5 Amyl butyrate Apricot

**Chemical Properties 1. Hydrolysis**

We have already learnt that hydrolysis of esters gives alcohol and carboxylic acid. **2\. Reaction with alcohol ( Transesterification)**

Esters of an alcohol can react with another alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid to give the ester of second alcohol. The interchange of alcohol portions of the esters is termed **transesterification**

Why is acid anhydride preferred to acyl chloride for carrying out acylation reactions ?

### Acid Amides
