## Chemical properties of carboxylic acids.


Carboxylic acid do not give the characteristic reaction of carbonyl group C = O as given by the aldehydes and ketones. as the carbonyl group of carboxylic acid is involved in resonance:

The reactions of carboxylic acids can be classified as follows:

A) Reactions involving cleavage of O – H bond.

B) Reactions involving cleavage of C – OH bond.

C) Reactions involving – COOH group.

D) Substitution reactions involving hydrocarbon part.

**A) Reactions involving cleavage of O – H bond.**

**1) Reactions with metals**

Carboxylic acid react with active metals like Na, Mg, Zn etc to form corresponding salts with the liberation of hydrogen.

**Example**

Acetic acid Sodium acetate

C OH + 2Na C ONa + H2

OO

2 CH3 2 CH3

**2) Reaction with alkalies**

Carboxylic acid reacts with alkalies to neutralise them and form salts.

**Example**

O O

Accteic acid Sodium acetate

**3) Reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates (Test for carboxylic acid group)**

Carboxylic acids decompose carbonates and bicarbonates evolving carbondioxide gas with effervescence.

**Example**

Acetic acid Sodium acetate

C OH + Na2CO3 C ONa + CO + H O2 2

OO

2CH3 2CH3

**4) All Carboxylic acids turn blue litmus red**

**B) Reactions involving cleavage of C-OH bond**

**1) Reactions with PCl5, PCl3 and SOCl2**

The hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids behaves like that of an alcoholic group and is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with PCl5, PCl3 or SOCl2.

**Example**

O

C OH + PCl5 C Cl + POCl3 + HCl

O

CH3 CH3

Acetic acid Acetyl Chloride

C OH + SOCl2 C Cl + SO2 + HCl

**2) Reactions with alcohols ( Esterification)** When carboxylic acids are heated with alcohols in the presence of conc. H2SO4 or dry HCl

gas, esters are formed. The reaction is reversible and is called esterification. **Example**

C OH + C 2 H

**C) Reactions involving – COOH group**

**1) Reduction**

**i) Partial reduction to alcohols**

Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols by LiAlH4 or with hydrogen in the presence of copper chromite as catalyst. Sodium borohydride does not reduce the – COOH group.

**Example**

C OH

O

CH3 CH3CH2OH + H2O LiAIH4

ethanoicacid ethanol 4(H)

**ii) Complete reduction to alkanes**

When treated with HI and red phosphorous, carboxylic acid undergoes complete reduction to yield alkanes containing the same number of carbon atoms.

**Example**

C OH + 6 HI

O

CH3 Red P

CH3 + 3I2 + 2H2OCH3

**2) Decarboxylation**

Removal of CO2 from carboxyl group is called as **decarboxylation.** Carboxylic acids lose carbon di oxide to form hydrocarbon when their sodium salts are heated with soda lime (NaOH and CaO in the ratio 3: 1)

**Example**

C ONa + NaOH

O

CH3 CH4 + Na2CO3

Sodium acetate Methane

CaO

**3) Kolbe’s electrolytic decarboxylation**

The aqueous solutions of sodium or potassium salts of carboxylic acid on electrolysis gives alkanes at anode. This reaction is called kolbes electrolysis.

**4) Reactions with ammonia**

Carboxylic acids react with ammonia to form ammonium salt which on further heating at high temperature gives amides.

**5) Action of heat in the presence of P2O5**

**D) Substitution reactions in the hydrocarbon part**

**1)** α **- Halogenation** Carboxylic acids having an α - hydrogen are halogenated at the α - position on

treatment with chlorine or bromine in the presence of small amount of red posphorus to form α halo carboxylic acids. This reaction is known as **Hell – Volhard – Zelinsky reaction** (HVZ reaction) The α - Halogenated acids are convenient starting materials for preparing α - substituted acids.

**2) Electrophilic substitution in aromatic carboxylic acids**

**iv) Benzoic acid does not undergo friedal craft's reaction. This is due to the strong** deactivating nature of the carboxyl group.

**E) Reducing action of Formic acid** Formic acid contains both an aldehyde as well as an acid group. Hence, like other aldehydes,

formic acid can easily be oxidised and therefore acts as a strong reducing agent

**Tests for carboxylic acid group** i) In aqueous solution carboxylic acid turn blue litmus red. ii) Carboxylic acids give brisk effervescence with sodium bicarbonate due to the evolution

of carbon-di -oxide. iii) When carboxylic acid is warmed with alcohol and Con H2SO4 it forms an ester, which

is detected by its fruity odour.
