## Test for Aldehydes i) Tollens Reagent Test


Tollens reagent is an ammonical silver nitrate solution. When an aldehyde is warmed with Tollens reagent a bright silver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal. This reaction is also called **silver mirror test** for aldehydes.

CH3 CHO + 2 \[Ag(NH3)2\]+ + 3OH**\-** CH3COO**\-** + 4NH3 + 2Ag + 2H2O

Silver

**ii) Fehlings solution Test** Fehlings solution is prepared by mixing equal volumes of Fehlings solution ‘A’ containing

aqueous copper sulphate and Fehlings solution ‘B’ containing alkaline solution of sodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt)

When aldehyde is warmed with Fehlings solution deep blue colour solution is changed to red precipitate of cuprous oxide.

**iii) Benedict's solution Test:** Benedicts solution is a mixture of CuSO4 + sodium citrate + NaOH. Cu2+ is reduced by

aldehyde to give red precipitate of cuprous oxide.

**iv) Schiffs’ reagent Test** Dilute solution of aldehydes when added to schiffs’ reagent (Rosaniline hydrochloride dissolved

in water and its red colour decolourised by passing SO2) yields its red colour. This is known as Schiffs’ **test** for aldehydes . Ketones do not give this test. Acetone however gives a positive test but slowly.
