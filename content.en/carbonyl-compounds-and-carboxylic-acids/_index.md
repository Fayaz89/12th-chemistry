**Adolf von Baeyer**

Adolf Von Baeyer, German research chemist who synthesized indigo (1880) and formulated its structure (1883). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905. Notable among Baeyer’s many achievements were the discovery of the phthalein dyes and his investigations of uric acid derivatives, polyacetylenes, and oxonium salts. One derivative of uric acid that he discovered was barbituric acid, the parent compound of the sedative-hypnotic drugs known as barbiturates.

**INTRODUCTION**

We come across many organic compounds containing a C

O group in our everyday Life.

Biomolecules such as protein, carbohydrate etc… that makeup all plants and animals contains carbonyl group. They play an important role in the metabolic process. For example, pyridoxal, an aldehyde derived from vitamin B, function as a co –enzyme. Carbonyl compounds are important constituents of fabrics, plastis and drugs. For example, Formaldehyde is used for the manufacture of Bakelite and paracetamol, (p– acetylated aminophenol) a drug used to reduce fever, contains a carbonyl group. In this unit, we will learn the preparation, properties and uses of aldhydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.

## Nomenclature of Aldehydes and ketones

## Structure of carbonyl group


The carbonyl carbon O

C is sp

2 hybridised and the carbon – oxygen bond is

similar to carbon – carbon double bond in alkenes. The carbonyl carbon forms three σbonds using their three sp2 hybridised orbital. One of the sigma bond is formed with oxygen and the other two with hydrogen and carbon (in aldehydes) or with two carbons (in ketones). All the three 'σ ' bonded atoms are lying on the same plane as shown in the fig (12.1). The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its unhybridised ‘2p’ orbital which lies perpendicular to the plane and it overlaps with 2p orbital of oxygen to form a carbon – oxygen **p** bond. The oxygen atom has two nonbonding pairs of electrons, which occupy its remaining two p-orbitals. Oxygen, the second most electro negative atom attracts the shaired pair of electron between the carbon and oxygen towards itself and hence the bond is polar. This polarisation contributes to the reactivity of aldehydes and ketones.

## General methods of preparation of aldehydes and ketones A. Preparation of aldehydes and ketones


**1.) Oxidation and catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols** We have already learnt that the oxidation of primary alcohol gives aldehydes and secondary

alcohol gives a ketone. Oxidising agents such as acidified Na Cr O KMnO PCC2 2 7 4, , are used for oxidation. Oxidation using PCC yield aldehydes . Other oxidising agents further oxidise the aldhydes / ketones in to carboxylic acids (Refer Unit No. - 11 Oxidation of alcohols)

When vapours of alcohols are passed over heavy metal catalyst such as Cu, Ag, alcohols give aldehydes and ketons. (Refer Unit No. - 11 Catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols **2.) Ozonolysis of alkenes**

We have already learnt in XI th standard that the reductive ozonolysis of alkenes gives aldehydes and ketones.

Alkenes react with ozone to form ozonide which on subsequent cleavage with zinc and water gives aldehydes and ketones. Zinc dust removes H2O2 formed, which otherwise can oxidise aldehydes / ketones.

**3\. Hydration of alkynes** We have already learnt in XI standard that the hydration of alkynes in presence of 40%

dilute sulpuric acid and 1% HgSO4 to give the corresponding aldehydes / ketones.

**B. Preparation of aldehydes**

**1) Rosenmund reduction a)** **Aldehydes** can be prepared by the hydrogenation of acid chloride, in the presence of

palladium supported by barium sulphate. This reaction is called Rosenmund reduction.

**Example**

CH3 C Cl + H2 CH3 C H + HCl

O O Pd/ BaSO4

Acetyl chloride Acetaldehyde

In this reaction, barium sulphate act as a catalytic poison to palladium catalyst, so that aldehyde cannot be further reduced to alcohol.

Formaldehyde and ketones cannot be prepared by this method.

**2\. Stephen's reaction** When alkylcyanides are reduced using SnCl / HCl2 , imines are formed, which on

hydrolysis gives corresponding aldehyde. +

**C) Preparation of benzaldehyde**

**1\. Side chain oxidation of toluene and its derivatives** by strong oxidising agents such as KMnO4 gives benzoic acid.

When chromylchloride is used as an oxidising agent, toluene gives benzaldehyde. This reaction is called **Etard reaction**. Acetic anhydride and CrO3 can also be used for this reaction.

## Physical properties of aldehydes and ketones
 1\. **Physical State:** Formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature and acetaldehyde is a volatile liquid. All

other aldehydes and ketones upto to C11 are colourless liquids while the higher ones are solids. 2. **Boiling points**

Aldehydes and ketones have relatively high boiling point as compared to hydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular mass. It is due to the weak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the dipole-dipole interactions.

C = O C = O C = O δ δ δ δδ δ

These dipole-dipole interactions are weaker than intermolecular H-bonding. The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are much lower than those of corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids which possess inter molecular hydrogen bonding.

3\. **Solubility** Lower members of aldehydes and ketones like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone

are miscible with water in all proportions because they form hydrogen bond with water. Solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly on increasing the length of alkyl

chain.

4\. **Dipolemoment:** The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones contains a double bond between carbon and

oxygen. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon and it attracts the shared pair of electron which makes the carbonyl group as polar and hence aldehydes and ketones have high dipole moments.

## Chemical properties of aldehydes and ketones A) Nucleophilic addition reactions


This reaction is the most common reactions of aldehydes and ketones. The carbonyl carbon carries a small degree of positive charge. Nucleophile such as CN

−can attack the carbonyl carbon and uses its lone pair to form a new carbon – nucleophile 'σ ' bond, at the same time two electrons from the carbon – oxygen double bond move to the most electronegative oxygen atom. This results in the formation of an alkoxide ion. In this process, the hybridisation of carbon changes from sp to sp2 3 .

**B) Oxidation of aldehydes and ketones**

**a) Oxidation of aldehydes** Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acid containing the same number of carbon

atom, as in parent aldehyde. The common oxidising agents are acidified K2Cr2O7, acidic or alkaline KMnO4 or chromic oxide.

**Example**

**b) Oxidation of ketone**

Ketones are not easily oxidised. Under drastic condition or with powerful oxidising agent like Con.HNO3, H+/KMnO4, H+/K2Cr2O7, cleavage of carbon-carbon bond takes place to give a mixture of carboxylic acids having less number of carbon atom than the parent ketone.

**C) Reduction reactions**

**(i) Reduction to alcohols**

We have already learnt that aldehydes and ketones can be easily reduced to primary and secondary alcohols respectively. The most commonly used reducing agents are Lithium Aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), and Sodium borohydride (NaBH4).

**a) Aldehyde are reduced to primary alcohols. Example**

CH3 C + 2 (H)

LiAlH4

CH3 CH2 OH

**b) Ketone are reduced to Secondary alcohols. Example**

CH3 C CH3 + 2(H)

O

NaBH4

Acetone OH

Isopropyl alcohol (2o)

CH3 3CH CH

The above reactions can also be carried out with hydrogen in the presence of metal catalyst like Pt, Pd, or Ni. LiAlH4 and NaBH4 do not reduce isolated carbon – carbon double bonds and double bond of benzene rings. In case of α, β unsaturated aldehyde and ketones, LiAlH4 reduces only C = O group leaving C = C bond as such.

**ii) Reduction to hydrocarbon**

The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to methylene group using suitable reducing agents to give hydrocarbons.

**E) Reaction involving alkylgroup**

**i)** **Aldol condensation**

The carbon attached to carbonyl carbon is called α - carbon and the hydrogen atom attached to α - carbon is called α - hydrogen.

In presence of dilute base NaOH, or KOH, two molecules of an aldehyde or ketone having α - hydrogen add together to give β- hydroxyl aldehyde (aldol) or β - hydroxyl ketone (ketol). The reaction is called aldol condensation reaction. The aldol or ketol readily loses water to give α,β – unsaturated compounds which are aldol condensation products.

**Mechanism**

The mechanism of aldol condensation of acetaldehyde takes place in three steps.

**Step 1 :**

The carbanion is formed as the α - hydrogen atom is removed as a proton by the base.

**CARBOXYLIC ACIDS Introduction**

Carbon compounds containing a carboxyl function group, -COOH are called carboxylic acids. The Carboxyl group is the combination of carbonyl group

O

C and the hydroxyl group (-OH).

However, carboxyl group has its own characteristic reaction. Carboxylic acids may be aliphatic (R – COOH) or aromatic (Ar – COOH) depending on the alkyl or aryl group attached to carboxylic carbon. Some higher members of aliphatic carboxylic acids (C12 to C18) known as fatty acids occur in natural fats as esters of glycerol.

## Structure of carboxyl group:
 The carboxyl group represent a planar arrangement of atoms. In – COOH group, the

centre carbon atom and both the oxygen atoms are in sp2 hybridisation. The three sp2 hybrid orbitals of the carbon atom overlap.

The two sp2 – hybridised orbitals of the carboxyl carbon overlap with one sp2 hybridised orbital of each oxygen atom while the third sp2 hybridised orbital of carbon overlaps with either a s -orbital of H – atom or a sp2 – hybridised orbital of C –atom of the alkyl group to form three s- bonds. Each of the two oxygen atoms and the carbon atom are left with one unhybridised p – orbital which is perpendicular to the s- bonding skeleton.

All these three p – orbitals being parallel overlap to form a π- bond which is partly delocalized between carbon and oxygen atom on one side, and carbon and oxygen of the OH group on the other side. In other words, RCOOH may be represented as a resonance hybrid of the following two canonical structures.

R - C

O :

O - H

R - C

O :

O - H

The carboxylic carbon is less electrophilic than carbonyl carbon because of the possible resonance structure. i.e., delocalisation of lone pair electrons from the oxygen in hydroxyl group.

## Methods of Preparation of carboxylic acids
 Some important methods for the preparation of carboxylic acids are as follows :

**1\. From Primary alcohols and aldehydes**

Primary alcohols and aldehydes can easily be oxidised to the corresponding carboxylic acids with oxidising agents such as potassium permanganate (in acidic or alkaline medium), potassium dichromate (in acidic medium)

**Example**

(O)

H+/ K2Cr2O7

(O)Ethyl alcohol Acetaldehyde Acetic acid CH3CH2OH CH3CHO CH3COOH

**2\. Hydrolysis of Nitriles**

Nitriles yield carboxylic acids when subjected to hydrolysis with an acid or alkali.

**Example**

CH3 C N + 2H2O CH3COOH + NH3 H+

Methyl cyanide Acetic acid

**3\. Acidic hydrolysis of esters** Esters on hydrolysis with dilute mineral acids yield corresponding carboxylic acid

**Example**

CH3 C OC2H5 + H2O CH3 H+

Ethyl acetate Acetic acid

C OH + C2H5OH

Ethyl alcohol

O O

**4\. From Grignard reagent**

Grignard reagent reacts with carbon di oxide (dry ice) to form salts of carboxylic acid which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acid after acidification with mineral acid.

**Example**

C O + CH3MgBr

O dry ether

171

Formic acid cannot be prepared by Grignard reagent since the acid contains only one carbon atom **5\. Hydrolysis of acylhalides and anhydrides**

a) Acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give Carboxylic acids.

**Example**

CH3 C Cl + H2O

Acetyl chloride

C6H5 C

Benzoic anhydride

2C6H5 C OH

O Benzoic acid

O C C6H5 + H2O

**6\. Oxidation of alkyl benzenes** Aromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of alkyl benzene with

chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium permanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to –COOH group irrespective of the length of the side chain.

**Example**

CH3

OH-/KMnO4

COOH

Toluene Benzoic acid

3(O)

**Evaluate yourself**

1) What happens when n-propyl benzene is oxidised using H+ / KMnO4?

2) How will you prepare benzoic acid using Grignard reagent.

## Physical Properties of carboxylic acids.
 i) Aliphatic carboxylic acid upto nine carbon atoms are colour less liquids with pungent

odour. The higher members are odourless wax like solids. ii) Carboxylic acids have higher boiling point than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols

of comparable molecular masses. This is due to more association of carboxylic acid molecules through intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

172

C R

O H O

OHO R C

**_Inter molecular hydrogen bonding_**

In fact, most of the carboxylic acids exist as dimer in its vapour phase.

iii) Lower aliphatic carboxylic acids (up to four carbon) are miscible with water due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with water. Higher carboxylic acid are insoluble in water due to increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon part. The simplest aromatic carboxylic acid, benzoic acid is insoluble in water.

iv) Vinegar is 6 to 8% solution of acetic acid in water. Pure acetic acid is called **glacial acetic** **acid.** Because it forms ice like crystal when cooled. When aqueous acetic acid is cooled at 289.5 K, acetic acid solidifies and forms ice like crystals, where as water remains in liquid state and removed by filtration. This process is repeated to obtain glacial acetic acid.

## Chemical properties of carboxylic acids.


Carboxylic acid do not give the characteristic reaction of carbonyl group C = O as given by the aldehydes and ketones. as the carbonyl group of carboxylic acid is involved in resonance:

The reactions of carboxylic acids can be classified as follows:

A) Reactions involving cleavage of O – H bond.

B) Reactions involving cleavage of C – OH bond.

C) Reactions involving – COOH group.

D) Substitution reactions involving hydrocarbon part.

**A) Reactions involving cleavage of O – H bond.**

**1) Reactions with metals**

Carboxylic acid react with active metals like Na, Mg, Zn etc to form corresponding salts with the liberation of hydrogen.

**Example**

Acetic acid Sodium acetate

C OH + 2Na C ONa + H2

OO

**D) Substitution reactions in the hydrocarbon part**

**1)** α **- Halogenation** Carboxylic acids having an α - hydrogen are halogenated at the α - position on

treatment with chlorine or bromine in the presence of small amount of red posphorus to form α halo carboxylic acids. This reaction is known as **Hell – Volhard – Zelinsky reaction** (HVZ reaction) The α - Halogenated acids are convenient starting materials for preparing α - substituted acids.

The resonance structure of carboxylate ion are given below.

The strength of carboxylic acid can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant(Ka):

178

R COOH + H2O RCOO **\-** + H3O+

Ka \[RCOO **\-** \] \[H3O+\]

\[RCOOH\] =

The dissociation constant is generally called acidity constant because it measures the relative strength of an acid. The stronger the acid, the higher will be its Ka value.

The dissociation constant of an acid can also be expressed in terms of pKa value.

pKa = - log Ka A stronger acid will have higher Ka value but smaller pKa value.

**Effect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acid.**

**i) Electron releasing alkyl group decreases the acidity**

The electron releasing groups (+I groups) increase the negative charge on the carboxylate ion and destabilise it and hence the loss of proton becomes difficult. For example, formic acid is more stronger than acetic acid.

**ii) Electron withdrawing substituents increases the acidity**

The electron – withdrawing substituents decrease the negative charge on the carboxylate ion and stabilize it. In such cases, the loss of proton becomes relatively easy.

Acidity increases with increasing electronegativity of the substituents. For example, the acidity of various halo acetic acids follows the order

F CH2 COOH > Cl CH2 COOH > Br CH2 COOH > I CH2 COOH

Acidity increases with increasing number of electron – withdrawing substituents on the α - carbon. For example

Cl3C COOH > Cl2CH COOH > ClCH2COOH > CH3COOH

The effect of various, electron withdrawing groups on the acidity of a carboxylic acid follows the order,

**\-** NO2 > **\-** CN > **\-** F > **\-** Cl > **\-** Br > **\-** I > Ph

The relative acidities of various organic compounds are

RCOOH > ArOH > H2O > ROH > RC CH

## Functional derivatives of carboxylic acids
 Compounds such as acid chlorides, amides, esters etc., are called carboxylic acid

derivatives because they differ from a carboxylic acid only in the nature of the group or atom that has replaced the -OH group of carboxylic acid.

**Relative reactivity of Acid derivatives** The reactivity of the acid derivatives follows the order

R C Cl > R C O C R > R C OR' > R C NH2

OO OO O

The above order of reactivity can be explained in terms of i) Basicity of the leaving group ii) Resonance effect

**(i)** **Basicity of the leaving group** Weaker bases are good leaving groups. Hence acyl derivatives with weaker bases as

leaving groups (L) can easily rupture the bond and are more reactive. The correct order of the basicity of the leaving group is H2N : > : OR > RCOO : > : Cl Hence the reverse is the order of reactivity.

**(ii) Resonance effect** Lesser the electronegativity of the group, greater would

be the resonance stabilization as shown below. This effect makes the molecule more stable and reduces the

reactivity of the acyl compound. The order of electronegativity of the leaving groups follows the order – Cl > - OCOR > - OR > - NH2

Hence the order of reactivity of the acid derivatives with nucleophilic reagent follows the order

acid halide > acid anhydride > esters > acid amides

**12\. 14. 2. Acid Halides:**

**Methods of Preparation of acid chloride:**

Acid chlorides are prepared from carboxylic acid by treating it with anyone of the chlorinating agent such as SOCl2, PCl5, or PCl3

**1) By reaction with thionyl Chloride (SOCl2)**

Acetic acid

This method is superior to others as the by products being gases escape leaving the acid chloride in the pure state.

**Physical properties:**

• They emit pale fumes of hydrogen chloride when exposed to air on account of their reaction with water vapour.

• They are insoluble in water but slowly begins to dissolve due to hydrolysis.

**Chemical properties:**

They react with weak nucleophiles such as water, alcohols, ammonia and amines to produce the corresponding acid, ester, amide or substituted amides.

**1) Hydrolysis.** Acyl halides undergo hydrolysis to form corresponding carboxylic acids
