**Adolf von Baeyer**

Adolf Von Baeyer, German research chemist who synthesized indigo (1880) and formulated its structure (1883). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905. Notable among Baeyer’s many achievements were the discovery of the phthalein dyes and his investigations of uric acid derivatives, polyacetylenes, and oxonium salts. One derivative of uric acid that he discovered was barbituric acid, the parent compound of the sedative-hypnotic drugs known as barbiturates.

**INTRODUCTION**

We come across many organic compounds containing a C

O group in our everyday Life.

Biomolecules such as protein, carbohydrate etc… that makeup all plants and animals contains carbonyl group. They play an important role in the metabolic process. For example, pyridoxal, an aldehyde derived from vitamin B, function as a co –enzyme. Carbonyl compounds are important constituents of fabrics, plastis and drugs. For example, Formaldehyde is used for the manufacture of Bakelite and paracetamol, (p– acetylated aminophenol) a drug used to reduce fever, contains a carbonyl group. In this unit, we will learn the preparation, properties and uses of aldhydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.
