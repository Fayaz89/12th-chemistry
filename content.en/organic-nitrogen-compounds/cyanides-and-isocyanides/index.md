Two types of alkyl derivatives can be obtained. Those derived by replacement of H – atom of hydrogen cyanide by the alkyl groups are known as alkyl cyanides (R-C N).≡ and those obtained by the replacement of H – atom of hydrogen isocyanide are known as alkyl isocyanides (R-N C)

In IUPAC system, alkyl cyanides are named as “alkanenitriles” whereas aryl cyanides as “ arenecarbonitrile”.

### Methods of preparation of cyanides


**1) From alkyl halides**

When alkyl halides are treated in the solution NaCN (or) KCN , alkyl cyanides are obtained. In this reaction a new carbon – carbon bond is formed.

**Example**

KCN + CH3CH2 - Br CH3CH2 - CN + KBr

Ethyl bromide Propanenitrile

Aryl cyanide cannot be prepared in this method because of their less reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution. Aryl cyanides are prepared using Sandmeyers reactions.

**2\. By dehydration of primary amides and aldoximes with** P O2 5

CH3 - CONH2 P2O5

\- H2O CH3 - CN

Acetamide Ethanenitrile

CH3 - CH=NOH P2O5

**3\. By dehydration of ammonium carboxylates with** 2 5P O

CH3 - COONH4

P2O5 CH3 - CN + 2H2O

Ammonium acetate Ethanenitrile

This method suitable for large scale preparation of alkyl cyanides.

**4\. From Grignard reagent**

Methyl magnesium bromide on treatment with cyanogen chloride (Cl - CN) forms ethanenitrile.

### Properties Of Cyanides


**Physical Properties**

The lower members (up to C14 ) are colourless liquids with a strong characteristic sweet smell. The higher members are crystalline solids, They are moderately soluble in water but freely souble in organic solvents. They are poisonous.

They have higher boiling points than analogous acetylenes due to their high dipole moments.

### Chemical properties


**1\. Hydrolysis**

**b) The nitriles containing α- hydrogen also undergo condensation with esters in the presence** of sodamide in ether to form ketonitriles. This reaction is known as “ Levine and Hauser” acetylation

This reaction involves replacement of ethoxy (OC H )2 5 group by methylnitrile (- CH CN)2 group and is called as cyanomethylation reaction.

### Alkyl Isocyanides (Carbylamines)


**Nomenclature of isocyanides**

### Methods of preparation of isocyanides 1. From primary amines (carbylamines reaction)


Both aromatic as well as aliphatic amines on treatment with CHCl3 in the presence of KOH give carbylamines

### Properties of isocyanides


**Physical properties**

• They are colourless, highly unpleasant smelling volatile liquids and are much more poisonous than the cyanides.

• They are only slightly soluble in water but are soluble in organic solvents.

• They are relatively less polar than alkyl cyanides. Thus, their melting point and boiling point are lower than cyanides.

### Chemical properties


1) **Hydrolysis**: Alkyl isocyanides are not hydrolysed by alkalies. However they are hydrolysed with dilute mineral acids to give primary amines and formic acids.

CH3 NC + 2H2O acid

CH3 NH2 + H COOH

2\. **Reduction:** When reduced catalytically (or) by nascent hydrogen, they give secondary amines.

3\. **Isomerisation:** When Alkyl isocyanides and heated at 2500C, they change into the more stable, isomeric cyanides
