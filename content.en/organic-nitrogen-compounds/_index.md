**Donald James Cram**

**Donald James Cram** was an American chemist who shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Jean-Marie Lehn and Charles J. Pedersen "for their development and use of molecules with structure-specifi c interactions of high selectivity." Th ey were the founders of the fi eld of host–guest chemistry Cram expanded upon Charles Pedersen's ground-breaking synthesis of crown ethers, two-dimensional organic compounds that are able to recognize and selectively combine with the ions of certain metal elements. He also did work in stereochemistry and Cram's rule of asymmetric induction is named aft er him.

**INTRODUCTION**

Organic compounds containing nitrogen are essential to life. For example; amines, the organic derivatives of ammonia play an important role in bioregulation, neurotransmission,etc., Pyridoxine, Vitamin B6 is an organic nitrogen compound which is needed to maintain the health of nerves, skin and red blood cells. Plants synthesise alkaloids, and biologically active amines to protect them from being eaten away by insects and other animals. Diazonium salts finds important applications in synthetic organic chemistry. Nitrogen compounds are the important constituents of explosives, drugs, dyes, fuels, polymers, synthetic rubbers, etc.,

In this unit, we will learn the preparation, properties and uses of nitrocompounds and amines.

## NITRO COMPOUNDS
 Nitro compounds are considered as the derivaties of hydrocarbons. If one of the hydrogen

atom of hydrocarbon is replaced by the -NO 2

group, the resultant organic compound is called a nitrocompound.

Nitroalkanes are represented by the formula, R-NO2 where R is an alkyl group (C H -)n 2n+1 . Nitroalkanes are further classified into primary, secondary, tertiary nitroalkanes on the basis of type of carbon atom to which the nitro (-NO )2 group is attached.

### Nomenclature of nitroalkanes


In the IUPAC nomenclature, the nitroalkanes are named by adding prefix nitro before the name of alkane, the position of the nitro group is indicated by number.

### ISOMERISM
 Nitroalkanes exhibit chain and position isomerism among their own class and functional

isomerism with alkyl nitrites and special type tautomerism can also exist in nitro alkanes having an α-H atom. For example, nitro compounds having the molecular formula C H NO

4 9 2 exhibit the following isomerisms. **Isomerism Structural formula of isomers Chain isomerism**: They differ in the length of carbon chain.

### Acidic nature of nitro alkanes


The α-H atom of 1 & 2 nitroalkanes show acidic character because of the electron with drawing effect of NO2 group. These are more acidic than aldehydes, ketones, ester and cyanides. Nitroalkanes dissolve in NaOH solution to form a salt. Aci – nitro derivatives are more acidic than nitro form. When the number of alkyl group attached to α carbon increases, acidity decreases. due to +I effect of alkyl groups.

The reaction follows SN2 mechanism.

This method is not suitable for preparing nitrobenzene because the bromine directly attached to the benzene ring cannot be cleaved easily.

**2) Vapour phase nitration of alkanes: (Industrial method)**

(or) persulphuric acid (H S O )2 2 8 (or) peroxytrifluro acetic acid (F C.CO H)3 3 as oxidising agent.

### Physical properties of nitro alkane
 The lower nitroalkanes are colourless pleasant smelling liquids, sparingly soluble in water,

but readily soluble in organic solvents like benzene, acetone etc… They have high boiling points because of their highly polar nature. Alkylnitrites have lower boiling points than nitro alkanes. ### Chemical properties of nitroalkanes

### Structure of amines


Like, ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and carries a lone pair of electron and sp3 hybridised, out of the four sp3 hybridised orbitals of nitrogen, three sp3 orbitals overlap with orbitals of hydrogen (or) alkyl groups of carbon, the fourth sp3 orbital contains a lone pair of electron. Hence, amines posses pyramidal geometry. Due to presence of lone pair of electron C- N- H (or) C- N- C bond angle is less than the normal tetrahedral bond angle 109.50. For example, the C- N- C bond angle of trimethylamine is 1080 which is lower than tetrahedral angle and higher than the H- N- H bond angle of 107˚ . This increase is due to the repulsion between the bulky methyl groups.

### General methods of preparation Amines
 Aliphatic and aromatic amines are prepared by the following methods.

**1) From nitro compounds** Reduction of Nitro compounds using H / Ni (or) Sn / HCl or Pd/H2 2 gives primary

amines.

**2) From nitriles a)** Reduction of alkyl or aryl cyanides with 2H /Ni (or) LiAlH (or) Na / C H OH4 2 5 gives

primary amines. The reduction reaction in which Na / C H OH2 5 is used as a reducing agent is called mendius reaction

CH3 CN Na(Hg) / C2 H5OH

**3) From amides**

**a)** Reduction of amides with LiAlH4 gives amines

R C

NH2 i) LiAlH4

ii) H2O R CH2 NH2

**b) Hoffmann’s degradation reaction**

When Amides are treated with bromine in the presence of aqueous or ethanolic solution of KOH, primary amines with one carbon atom less than the parent amides are obtained.

**Example:**

R C

Primary amine

**4) From alkyl halides a) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis**

Gabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of Aliphatic primary amines. Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic KOH forms potassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide followed by alkaline hydrolysis gives primary amine. Aniline cannot be prepared by this method because the arylhalides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by phthalimide

This is a nucleophilic substitution , the halide ion of alkyl halide is substituted by the -NH2

group. The product primary amine so formed can also has a tendency to act as a nucleophile and hence if excess alkyl halide is taken, further nucleophilic substitution takes place leading

### Properties of amines


**1\. Physical state and smell** The lower aliphatic amines

1 2(C -C ) are colourless gases and have ammonia like smell and those with four or more carbons are volatile liquids with fish like smell.

Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but when exposed to air they become coloured due to oxidation.

**2\. Boiling point** Due to the polar nature of primary and secondary amines, can form intermolecular

hydrogen bonds using their lone pair of electorn on nitrogen atom. There is no such H-bonding in tertiary amines.

Amines have lower boiling point than alcohols because nitrogen has lower electronegative value than oxygen and hence the N-H bond is less polar than -OH bond.

**4\.** CH CH(OH)CH3 3 60 355

**5\.** CH CH CH CH3 2 2 3 58 272.5

**3) Solubility**

Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water, because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases with increase in molecular mass of amines due to increase in size of the hydrophobic alkyl group. Amines are insoluble in water but readily soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether etc.

### Chemical properties


The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom in amines makes them basic as well as nucleophilic. They react with acids to form salts and also react with electrophiles.

They form salts with mineral acids

**Example:**

C6H5 NH2 + HCl C6H5 NH3Cl-**..**

Aniline Anilinium chloride

**Expression for basic strength of amines**

In the aqueous solutions, the following equilibrium exists and it lies far to the left, hence amines are weak bases compared to NaOH .

**Influence of structure on basic character of amines**

The factors which increase the availability of electron pair on nitrogen for sharing with an acid will increase the basic character of an amine. When a +I group like an alkyl group is attached to the nitrogen increase the electron density on nitrogen which makes the electron pair readily available for protonation.

a) Hence alkyl amines are stronger bases than ammonia.

Therefore, the expected order of basicity of aliphatic amines (in gas phase) is

The above order is not regular in their aqueous solution as evident by their pKb values given in the table.

To compare the basicity of amines, the inductive effect, solvation effect, steric hindrance, etc., should be taken into consideration.

**Solvation effect**

In the aqueous solution, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilized not only by electron releasing (+I) effect of the alkyl group but also by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion, lesser will be the solvation. The order of stability of the protonated amines is greater the size of the ion, lesser is the solvation and lesser is the stability. In case of secondary and tertiary amines, due to steric hindrance, the alkyl groups decrease the number of water molecules that can approach the protonated amine. Therefore the order of basicity is,

1˚ > 2˚ > 3˚

Based on these effects we can conclude that the order of basic strength in case of alkyl substituted amines in aqueous solution is

(CH3)2NH > CH3 - NH2 > (CH3)3N > NH3 **........**

**.. .. .. ..** (C2H5)2 NH > (C2H5)3 N > C2H5 NH2 > NH3

The resultant of +I effect, steric effect and hydration effect cause the 20 amine, more basic.

**Basic strength of aniline**

In aniline, the NH 2

group is directly attached to the benzene ring. The lone pair of electron on nitrogen atom in aniline gets delocalised over the benzene ring and hence it is less available for protonation makes the, aromatic amines (aniline) less basic than NH3.

In case of substituted aniline, electron releasing groups like -CH3,-OCH3,-NH2 increase the basic strength and electron withdrawing group like - NO2,-X,-COOH decrease the basic strength.

**7\. Electrophilic substitution reactions in Aniline**

The -N H ..

2 group is a strong activating group. In aniline the 2NH is directly attached to the benzene ring, the lone pair of

electrons on the nitrogen is in conjugation with benzene ring which increases the electron density at ortho and para position, thereby facilitating the electrophilic attack at ortho and para positions.

### Physical properties


• Benzene diazonium chloride is a colourless, crystalline solid.

• These are readily soluble in water and stable in cold water. However it reacts with warm water.

• Their aqueous solutions are neutral to litmus and conduct electricity due to the presence to ions.

• Benzenediazonium tetrafluoro borate is soluble in water and stable at room temperature.

### Methods of preparation of cyanides


**1) From alkyl halides**

When alkyl halides are treated in the solution NaCN (or) KCN , alkyl cyanides are obtained. In this reaction a new carbon – carbon bond is formed.

**Example**

KCN + CH3CH2 - Br CH3CH2 - CN + KBr

Ethyl bromide Propanenitrile

Aryl cyanide cannot be prepared in this method because of their less reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution. Aryl cyanides are prepared using Sandmeyers reactions.

**2\. By dehydration of primary amides and aldoximes with** P O2 5

CH3 - CONH2 P2O5

\- H2O CH3 - CN

Acetamide Ethanenitrile

CH3 - CH=NOH P2O5

**3\. By dehydration of ammonium carboxylates with** 2 5P O

CH3 - COONH4

P2O5 CH3 - CN + 2H2O

Ammonium acetate Ethanenitrile

This method suitable for large scale preparation of alkyl cyanides.

**4\. From Grignard reagent**

Methyl magnesium bromide on treatment with cyanogen chloride (Cl - CN) forms ethanenitrile.

CH3 - MgBr + Cl CN CH3 - CN + Mg Br

### Properties Of Cyanides


**Physical Properties**

The lower members (up to C14 ) are colourless liquids with a strong characteristic sweet smell. The higher members are crystalline solids, They are moderately soluble in water but freely souble in organic solvents. They are poisonous.

They have higher boiling points than analogous acetylenes due to their high dipole moments.

### Properties of isocyanides


**Physical properties**

• They are colourless, highly unpleasant smelling volatile liquids and are much more poisonous than the cyanides.

• They are only slightly soluble in water but are soluble in organic solvents.

• They are relatively less polar than alkyl cyanides. Thus, their melting point and boiling point are lower than cyanides.

### Chemical properties


1) **Hydrolysis**: Alkyl isocyanides are not hydrolysed by alkalies. However they are hydrolysed with dilute mineral acids to give primary amines and formic acids.

CH3 NC + 2H2O acid
