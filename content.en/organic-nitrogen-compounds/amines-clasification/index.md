### Structure of amines


Like, ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and carries a lone pair of electron and sp3 hybridised, out of the four sp3 hybridised orbitals of nitrogen, three sp3 orbitals overlap with orbitals of hydrogen (or) alkyl groups of carbon, the fourth sp3 orbital contains a lone pair of electron. Hence, amines posses pyramidal geometry. Due to presence of lone pair of electron C- N- H (or) C- N- C bond angle is less than the normal tetrahedral bond angle 109.50. For example, the C- N- C bond angle of trimethylamine is 1080 which is lower than tetrahedral angle and higher than the H- N- H bond angle of 107˚ . This increase is due to the repulsion between the bulky methyl groups.

### General methods of preparation Amines
 Aliphatic and aromatic amines are prepared by the following methods.

**1) From nitro compounds** 
Reduction of Nitro compounds using H / Ni (or) Sn / HCl or Pd/H2 2 gives primary amines.

$\ce{CH3CH2-NO2->[{3H2/ Ni(or)}][Fe/HCl,6[H]]CH3CH2-NH2+2H2O}$


$\ce{C6H5-NO2->[3H2/ Pt, 680 K][(or) Sn / HCl]C6H5-NH2+2H2O}$


**2) From nitriles a)** 
Reduction of alkyl or aryl cyanides with 2H /Ni (or) LiAlH (or) Na / C H OH4 2 5 gives

primary amines. The reduction reaction in which Na / C H OH2 5 is used as a reducing agent is called mendius reaction

**3) From amides**

ii) H2O R CH2 NH2

**b) Hoffmann’s degradation reaction**

When Amides are treated with bromine in the presence of aqueous or ethanolic solution of KOH, primary amines with one carbon atom less than the parent amides are obtained.

**Example:**

R C

R NH2 + K2 CO3 + KBr + H2ONH2

**4) From alkyl halides**

**a) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis**

Gabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of Aliphatic primary amines. Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic KOH forms potassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide followed by alkaline hydrolysis gives primary amine. Aniline cannot be prepared by this method because the arylhalides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by phthalimide
![](5.png)

**b) Hoffmann’s ammonolysis**

When Alkyl halides (or) benzylhalides are heated with alcoholic ammonia in a sealed tube, mixtures of 10, 20 and 30 amines and quaternary ammonium salts are obtained.

This is a nucleophilic substitution , the halide ion of alkyl halide is substituted by the -NH2

group. The product primary amine so formed can also has a tendency to act as a nucleophile and hence if excess alkyl halide is taken, further nucleophilic substitution takes place leading

to the formation of quarternary ammonium salt. However, if the process is carried out with excess ammonia, primary amine is obtained as the major product.

### Properties of amines


**1\. Physical state and smell** The lower aliphatic amines

1 2(C -C ) are colourless gases and have ammonia like smell and those with four or more carbons are volatile liquids with fish like smell.

Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but when exposed to air they become coloured due to oxidation.

**2\. Boiling point** Due to the polar nature of primary and secondary amines, can form intermolecular

hydrogen bonds using their lone pair of electorn on nitrogen atom. There is no such H-bonding in tertiary amines.

The boiling point of various amines follows the order,

CH3 NH2 **..**

\> (CH3)2 NH **..**

\> (CH3)3 N **..**

1 2 3> >° °°

Amines have lower boiling point than alcohols because nitrogen has lower electronegative value than oxygen and hence the N-H bond is less polar than -OH bond.

**Table Boiling points of amines, alcohols and alkanes of comparable molecular weight.**


| S.NO. |C ompound |Molecular mass |Boiling point (K) |

| 1. |CH3(CH2)2NH2 |59 |321 |
| 2. |C2H5-NH-CH3 |59 |308 |
| 3. |(CH3)3N|59 |277 |
| 4. |CH CH3(OH)CH3 |60 |355 |
| 5. |CH3CH2CH2CH3 |58 |272.5 |
  



**3) Solubility**

Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water, because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases with increase in molecular mass of amines due to increase in size of the hydrophobic alkyl group. Amines are insoluble in water but readily soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether etc.

### Chemical properties


The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom in amines makes them basic as well as nucleophilic. They react with acids to form salts and also react with electrophiles.

They form salts with mineral acids

**Example:**

C6H5 NH2 + HCl C6H5 NH3Cl-**..**

Aniline Anilinium chloride

**Expression for basic strength of amines**

In the aqueous solutions, the following equilibrium exists and it lies far to the left, hence amines are weak bases compared to NaOH .

we know that,

Larger the value of Kb or smaller the value of pKb, stronger is the base.

**Influence of structure on basic character of amines**

The factors which increase the availability of electron pair on nitrogen for sharing with an acid will increase the basic character of an amine. When a +I group like an alkyl group is attached to the nitrogen increase the electron density on nitrogen which makes the electron pair readily available for protonation.

a) Hence alkyl amines are stronger bases than ammonia.

Consider the reaction of an alkyl amine (R- N H ). .2 with a proton

. . (R-N H ) and provide unshared electron pair more available for sharing with proton.

Therefore, the expected order of basicity of aliphatic amines (in gas phase) is

R3N **. .**

\> R2NH **. .**

\> R-NH2 **. .**

(30) (20) (10)

The above order is not regular in their aqueous solution as evident by their pKb values given in the table.

To compare the basicity of amines, the inductive effect, solvation effect, steric hindrance, etc., should be taken into consideration.

**Solvation effect**

In the aqueous solution, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilized not only by electron releasing (+I) effect of the alkyl group but also by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion, lesser will be the solvation. The order of stability of the protonated amines is greater the size of the ion, lesser is the solvation and lesser is the stability. In case of secondary and tertiary amines, due to steric hindrance, the alkyl groups decrease the number of water molecules that can approach the protonated amine. Therefore the order of basicity is,

1˚ > 2˚ > 3˚

Based on these effects we can conclude that the order of basic strength in case of alkyl substituted amines in aqueous solution is

(CH3)2NH > CH3 - NH2 > (CH3)3N > NH3 **........**

**.. .. .. ..** (C2H5)2 NH > (C2H5)3 N > C2H5 NH2 > NH3

The resultant of +I effect, steric effect and hydration effect cause the 20 amine, more basic.

**Basic strength of aniline**

In aniline, the NH 2

group is directly attached to the benzene ring. The lone pair of electron on nitrogen atom in aniline gets delocalised over the benzene ring and hence it is less available for protonation makes the, aromatic amines (aniline) less basic than NH3.

In case of substituted aniline, electron releasing groups like -CH3,-OCH3,-NH2 increase the basic strength and electron withdrawing group like - NO2,-X,-COOH decrease the basic strength.

**7\. Electrophilic substitution reactions in Aniline**

The -N H ..

2 group is a strong activating group. In aniline the 2NH is directly attached to the benzene ring, the lone pair of

electrons on the nitrogen is in conjugation with benzene ring which increases the electron density at ortho and para position, thereby facilitating the electrophilic attack at ortho and para positions.

**iv) Aniline** It does not under go Friedel – Crafts reaction (alkylation and acetylation) we know aniline

is basic in nature and it donates its lone pair to the lewis acid AlCl3 to form an adduct which inhibits further the electrophilic substitution reaction.
