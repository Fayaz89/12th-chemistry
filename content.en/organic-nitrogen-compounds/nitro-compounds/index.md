## NITRO COMPOUNDS
 Nitro compounds are considered as the derivaties of hydrocarbons. If one of the hydrogen

atom of hydrocarbon is replaced by the -NO 2

group, the resultant organic compound is called a nitrocompound.

Nitroalkanes are represented by the formula, R-NO2 where R is an alkyl group (C H -)n 2n+1 . Nitroalkanes are further classified into primary, secondary, tertiary nitroalkanes on the basis of type of carbon atom to which the nitro (-NO )2 group is attached.

### Nomenclature of nitroalkanes


In the IUPAC nomenclature, the nitroalkanes are named by adding prefix nitro before the name of alkane, the position of the nitro group is indicated by number.

### ISOMERISM
 Nitroalkanes exhibit chain and position isomerism among their own class and functional

isomerism with alkyl nitrites and special type tautomerism can also exist in nitro alkanes having an α-H atom. For example, nitro compounds having the molecular formula C H NO

4 9 2 exhibit the following isomerisms. **Isomerism Structural formula of isomers Chain isomerism**: They differ in the length of carbon chain.

### Acidic nature of nitro alkanes


The α-H atom of 1 & 2 nitroalkanes show acidic character because of the electron with drawing effect of NO2 group. These are more acidic than aldehydes, ketones, ester and cyanides. Nitroalkanes dissolve in NaOH solution to form a salt. Aci – nitro derivatives are more acidic than nitro form. When the number of alkyl group attached to α carbon increases, acidity decreases. due to +I effect of alkyl groups.

### Preparation of nitroalkanes 1) From alkyl halides: (Laboratory method) a)

nitroethane. CH3CH2 -Br + K ethanol/

The reaction follows SN2 mechanism.

This method is not suitable for preparing nitrobenzene because the bromine directly attached to the benzene ring cannot be cleaved easily.

**2) Vapour phase nitration of alkanes: (Industrial method)**

Gaseous mixture of methane and nitric acid passed through a red hot metal tube to give nitromethane.

Except methane, other alkanes (upto n – hexane) give a mixture of nitroalkanes due to C-C cleavage. The individual nitro alkanes can be separated by fractional distillation.

(or) persulphuric acid (H S O )2 2 8 (or) peroxytrifluro acetic acid (F C.CO H)3 3 as oxidising agent.

### Physical properties of nitro alkane
 The lower nitroalkanes are colourless pleasant smelling liquids, sparingly soluble in water,

but readily soluble in organic solvents like benzene, acetone etc… They have high boiling points because of their highly polar nature. Alkylnitrites have lower boiling points than nitro alkanes. ### Chemical properties of nitroalkanes


Nitroalkanes undergo the following common reactions. i. Reduction ii. Hydrolysis iii. Halogenations

**ii.** **Hydrolysis of nitroalkanes**

Hydrolysis can be effected using conc. HCl or conc. H SO2 4 . Primary nitroalkanes on hydrolysis gives carboxylic acid, and the secondary nitroalkanes give ketones. The tertiary nitroalkanes have no reaction.
