**Kenneth wade (1932–2014)**

Kenneth Wade, was a British chemist, and professor emeritus at Durham University. He developed a method for the prediction of shapes of borane clusters. Wade’s rules are used to rationalize the shape of borane clusters by calculating the total number of skeletal electron pairs (SEP) available for cluster bonding. For his substantial contribution, Kenneth Wade was granted FRS award from royal society, London In 1989.He received the Tilden prize award in 1999 from the Royal Society of Chemistry for advances in chemistry.

**INTRODUCTION**

We have already learnt the classification of elements into four blocks namely s, p, d and f. We have also learnt the properties of s-block elements and their important compounds in the XI standard. This year we learn the elements of remaining blocks, starting with p-block elements.

The elements in which their last electron enters the 'p' orbital, constitute the p-block elements. They are placed in 13th to 18th groups of the modern periodic table and the first member of the groups are B, C, N, O, F and He respectively. These elements have quite varied properties and this block contains nonmetals, metals and metalloids. Nonmetallic elements of this group have more varied properties than metals. The elements of this block and their compounds play an important role in our day to day life, for example, without molecular oxygen we cannot imagine the survival of living system. The most abundant metal aluminium and its alloys have plenty of applications ranging from household utensils to parts of aircraft. The semi conducting nature of elements such as silicon and germanium made a revolutionary change in the field of modern electronics. In this unit we discuss the properties of first three groups (Group 13 - 15) of p-block elements namely boron, carbon and nitrogen family elements and their important compounds.

## General trends in properties of p-block elements:
 We already learnt that the properties of elements largely depends on their electronic

configuration, size, ionisation enthalpy, electronegativity etc... Let us discuss the general trend in such properties of various p-block elements.

### Electronic configuration and oxidation state:


The p-block elements have a general electronic configuration of ns2, np1-6. The elements of each group have similar outer shell electronic configuration and differ only in the value of n (principal quantum number). The elements of group 18 (inert gases) have completely filled p orbitals, hence they are more stable and have least reactivity. The elements of this block show variable oxidation state and their highest oxidation state (group oxidation state) is equal to the total number of valance electrons present in them. Unlike s-block elements which show only positive oxidation state, some of the p-block elements show negative oxidation states also. The halogens have a strong tendency to gain an electron to give a stable halide ion with completely filled electronic configuration and hence -1 oxidation state is more common in halogens. Similarly, the other elements belonging to pnictogen and chalcogen groups also show negative oxidation states.

### Metallic nature:


The tendency of an element to form a cation by loosing electrons is known as electropositive or metallic character. This character depends on the ionisation energy. Generally on descending a group the ionisation energy decreases and hence the metallic character increases.

In p-block, the elements present in lower left part are metals while the elements in the upper right part are non metals. Elements of group 13 have metallic character except the first element boron which is a metalloid, having properties intermediate between the metal and nonmetals. The atomic radius of boron is very small and it has relatively high nuclear charge and these properties are responsible for its nonmetallic character. In the subsequent groups the non-metallic character increases. In group 14 elements, carbon is a nonmetal while silicon and germanium are metalloids. In group 15, nitrogen and phosphorus are non metals and arsenic & antimony are metalloids. In group 16, oxygen, sulphur and selenium are non metals and tellurium is a metalloid. All the elements of group 17 and 18 are non metals.

### Ionisation Enthalpy:


We have already learnt that as we move down a group, generally there is a steady decrease in ionisation enthalpy of elements due to increase in their atomic radius. In p-block elements, there are some minor deviations to this general trend. In group 13, from boron to aluminium the ionisation enthalpy decreases as expected. But from aluminium to thallium there is only a marginal difference. This is due to the presence of inner d and f-electrons which has poor shielding effect compared to s and p-electrons. As a result, the effective nuclear charge on the valance electrons increases. A similar trend is also observed in group 14. The remaining groups (15 to 18) follow the general trend. In these groups, the ionisation enthalpy decreases, as we move down the group. Here, poor shielding effect of d- and f-electrons are overcome by the increased shielding effect of the additional p-electrons. The ionisation enthalpy of elements in successive groups is higher than the corresponding elements of the previous group as expected.

### Electronegativity


As we move down the 13th group, the electronegativity first decreases from boron to aluminium and then marginally increases for Gallium, thereafter there is no appreciable change. Similar trend is also observed in 14 th group as well. In other groups, as we move down the group, the electro negativity decreases. This observed trend can be correlated with their atomic radius.

### Anomalous properties of the first elements:


In p-block elements, the first member of each group differs from the other elements of the corresponding group. The following factors are responsible for this anomalous behaviour.

1\. Small size of the first member 2. High ionisation enthalpy and high electronegativity 3. Absence of d orbitals in their valance shell

The first member of the group 13, boron is a metalloid while others are reactive metals. Moreover, boron shows diagonal relationship with silicon of group 14. The oxides of boron and silicon are similar in their acidic nature. Both boron and silicon form covalent hydrides that can be easily hydrolysed. Similarly, except boron trifluoride, halides of both elements are readily hydrolysed.

In group 14, the first element carbon is strictly a nonmetal while other elements are metalloids (silicon & germanium) or metals (tin & lead). Unlike other elements of the group carbon can form multiple bonds such as C=C, C=O etc... Carbon has a greater tendency to form a chain of bonds with itself or with other atoms which is known as catenation. There is considerable decrease in catenation property down the group (C>>Si>Ge≈Sn>Pb).

In group 15 also the first element nitrogen differs from the rest of the elements of the group. Like carbon, the nitrogen can from multiple bonds (N=N, C=N, N=O etc...). Nitrogen is a diatomic gas unlike the other members of the group. Similarly in group 16, the first element, oxygen also exists as a diatomic gas in that group. Due to its high electronegativity it forms hydrogen bonds.

The first element of group 17, fluorine the most electronegative element, also behaves quiet differently compared to the rest of the members of group. Like oxygen it also forms hydrogen bonds. It shows only -1 oxidation state while the other halogens have +1, +3, +5 and +7 oxidation states in addition to -1 state. The fluorine is the strongest oxidising agent and the most reactive element among the halogens.

### Inert pair effect:


We have already learnt that the alkali and alkaline earth metals have an oxidation state of +1 and +2 respectively, corresponding to the total number of electrons present in them. Similarly, the elements of p-block also show the oxidation states corresponding to the maximum number of valence electrons (group oxidation state). In addition they also show variable oxidation state. In case of the heavier post-transition elements belonging to the groups (13 to 16), the most stable oxidation state is two less than the group oxidation state and there is a reluctance to exhibit the group oxidation state. Let us consider group 13 elements. As we move from boron to heavier elements, there is an increasing tendency to have +1 oxidation state, rather than the group oxidation state, +3. For example Al+3 is more stable than Al+1 while Tl+1 is more stable than Tl+3. Aluminium(III)chloride is stable whereas thallium(III)chloride is highly unstable and disproportionates to thallium(I) chloride and chlorine gas. This shows that in thallium the stable lower oxidation state corresponds to the loss of np electrons only and not ns electrons. Thus in heavier post- transition metals, the outer s electrons (ns) have a tendency to remain inert and show reluctance to take part in the bonding, which is known as inert pair effect. This effect is also observed in groups 14, 15 and 16.

### Allotropism in p-block elements:


Some elements exist in more than one crystalline or molecular forms in the same physical state. For example, carbon exists as diamond and graphite. This phenomenon is called allotropism (in greek 'allos' means another and 'trope' means change) and the different forms of an element are called allotropes. Many p-block elements show allotropism and some of the common allotropes are listed in the table.

## Group 13 (Boron group) elements: 2.2.1 Occurrence:


The boron occurs mostly as borates and its important ores are borax - Na2\[B4O5(OH)4\].8H2O and kernite - Na2\[B4O5(OH)4\].2H2O.. Aluminium is the most abundant metal and occurs as oxides and also found in aluminosilicate rocks. Commercially it is extracted from its chief ore, bauxite (Al2O3.2H2O). The other elements of this group occur only in trace amounts. The other elements Ga, In and Tl occur as their sulphides.

### Chemical properties of boron:


Boron is the only nonmetal in this group and is less reactive. However, it shows reactivity at higher temperatures. Many of its compounds are electron deficient and has unusual type of covalent bonding which is due to its small size, high ionisation energy and similarity in electronegativity with carbon and hydrogen.

**Formation of metal borides:**

Many metals except alkali metals form borides with a general formula MxBy (x ranging upto 11 and y ranging upto 66 or higher)

**Direct combination of metals with boron:**

Cr + nB 1500 K CrBn

**Reduction of borontrihalides:**

Reduction of borontrichloride with a metal assisted by dihydrogen gives metal borides.

2BCl 3 + 2W 1500 K 2WB + 2Cl 2+2HCl H2

**Formation of hydrides:**

Boron does not react directly with hydrogen. However, it forms a variety of hydrides called boranes. The simplest borane is diborane - B2H6. Other larger boranes can be prepared from diborane. Treatment of gaseous boron trifluoride with sodium hydride around 450 K gives diborane. To prevent subsequent pyrolysis, the product diborane is trapped immediately.

2BF3 + 6NaH 450 K B2H6 + 6NaF

**Formation of boron trihalides:**

Boron combines with halogen to form boron trihalides at high temperatures.

### Diborane


**Preparation:**

As discussed earlier diborane can be prepared by the action of metal hydride with boron. This method is used for the industrial production.

Diborane can also be obtained in small quantities by the reaction of iodine with sodium borohydride in diglyme.

2NaBH4 + I2 B2H6 + 2NaI + H2

On heating magnesium boride with HCl a mixture of volatile boranes are obtained.

**Structure of diborane:**

In diborane two BH2 units are linked by two bridged hydrogens. Therefore, it has eight B-H bonds. However, diborane has only 12 valance electrons and are not sufficient to form normal covalent bonds. The four terminal B-H bonds are normal covalent bonds (two centre - two electron bond or 2c-2e bond). The remaining four electrons have to be used for the bridged bonds. i.e. two three centred B-H-B bonds utilise two electrons each. Hence, these bonds are three centre- two electron bonds (3c-2e). The bridging hydrogen atoms are in a plane as shown in the figure 2.3. In diborane, the boron is sp3 hybridised.

Three of the four sp3 hybridised orbitals contains single electron and the fourth orbital is empty. Two of the half filled hybridised orbitals of each boron overlap with the 1s orbitals of two hydrogens to form four terminal 2c-2e bonds, leaving one empty and one half filled hybridised orbitals on each boron. The Three centre - two electron bonds), B-H-B bond formation involves overlapping the half filled hybridised orbital of one boron, the empty hybridised orbital of the other boron and the half filled 1s orbital of hydrogen.

### Tendency for catenation


Catenation is an ability of an element to form chain of atoms. The following conditions are necessary for catenation. (i) the valency of element is greater than or equal to two, (ii) element should have an ability to bond with itself (iii) the self bond must be as strong as its bond with other elements (iv) kinetic inertness of catenated compound towards other molecules. Carbon possesses all the above properties and forms a wide range of compounds with itself and with other elements such as H, O, N, S and halogens.

### Allotropes of carbon


Carbon exists in many allotropic forms. Graphite and diamond are the most common allotropes. Other important allotropes are graphene, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes.

**Graphite** is the most stable allotropic form of carbon at normal temperature and pressure. It is soft and conducts electricity. It is composed of flat two dimensional sheets of carbon atoms. Each sheet is a hexagonal net of sp2 hybridised carbon atoms with a C-C bond length of 1.41 Å which is close to the

C-C bond distance in benzene (1.40 Å). Each carbon atom forms three σ bonds with three neighbouring carbon atoms using three of its valence electrons and the fourth electron present in the unhybridised p orbital forms a π-bond. These π electrons are delocalised over the entire sheet which is responsible for its electrical conductivity. The successive carbon sheets are held together by weak vander Waals forces. The distance between successive sheet is 3.40 Å. It is used as a lubricant either on its own or as a graphited oil.

Unlike graphite the other allotrope **diamond is very hard. The carbon atoms in** diamond are sp3 hybridised and bonded to four neighbouring carbon atoms by σ bonds with a C-C bond length of 1.54 Å. This results in a tetrahedral arrangement around each carbon atom that extends to the entire lattice as shown in figure 2.5. Since all four valance electrons of carbon are involved in bonding there is no free electrons for conductivity. Being the hardest element, it used for sharpening hard tools, cutting glasses, making bores and rock drilling.

**Fullerenes** are newly synthesised allotropes of carbon. Unlike graphite and diamond, these allotropes are discrete molecules such as C32, C50, C60, C70, C76 etc.. These molecules have cage like structures as shown in the figure. The C60 molecules have a soccer ball like structure and is called buckminster fullerene or buckyballs. It has a fused ring structure consists of 20 six membered rings and 12 five membered rings. Each carbon atom is sp2 hybridised and forms three σ bonds & a delocalised π bond giving aromatic character to these molecules. The C-C bond distance is 1.44 Å and C=C distance 1.38 Å.

Carbon nanotubes, another recently discovered allotropes, have graphite like tubes with fullerene ends. Along the axis, these nanotubes are stronger than steel and conduct electricity. These have many applications in nanoscale electronics, catalysis, polymers and medicine.

### Carbon monoxide \[CO\]:


**Preparation:**

Carbon monoxide can be prepared by the reaction of carbon with limited amount of oxygen.

2C + O2 2CO

On industrial scale carbon monoxide is produced by the reaction of carbon with air. The carbon monoxide formed will contain nitrogen gas also and the mixture of nitrogen and carbon monoxide is called producer gas.

2C + O2/N2 (air) 2CO + N2 Producers Gas

The producer gas is then passed through a solution of copper(I)chloride under pressure which results in the formation of CuCl(CO).2H2O. At reduced pressures this solution releases the pure carbon monoxide.

Pure carbon monoxide is prepared by warming methanoic acid with concentrated sulphuric acid which acts as a dehydrating agent.

HCOOH + H2SO4 CO + H2SO4 . H2O

**Properties**

It is a colourless, odourless, and poisonous gas. It is slightly soluble in water.

It burns in air with a blue flame forming carbon dioxide. 2CO + O2 2CO2

When carbon monoxide is treated with chlorine in presence of light or charcoal, it forms a poisonous gas carbonyl chloride, which is also known as phosgene. It is used in the synthesis of isocyanates.

CO + Cl2 COCl2

Carbon monoxide acts as a strong reducing agent. 3CO + Fe2O3 2Fe + 3CO2

Under high temperature and pressure a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen (synthetic gas or syn gas) gives methanol.

CO + 2H2 CH3OH

In oxo process, ethene is mixed with carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas to produce propanal.

nCO + 2nH2 CnH2n + nH2O

Carbon monoxide forms numerous complex compounds with transition metals in which the transition meal is in zero oxidation state. These compounds are obtained by heating the metal with carbon monoxide.

Eg. Nickel tetracarbonyl \[Ni(CO)4\], Iron pentacarbonyl \[Fe(CO)5\], Chromium hexacarbonyl \[Cr(CO)6\].

**Structure:**

It has a linear structure. In carbon monoxide, three electron pairs are shared between carbon and oxygen. The bonding can be explained using molecular orbital theory as discussed in XI standard. The C-O bond distance is 1.128Å. The structure can be considered as the resonance hybrid of the following two canonical forms.

OC C O OC

**Uses of carbon monoxide:**

1\. Equimolar mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - water gas and the mixture of carbon monoxide and nitrogen - producer gas are important industrial fuels

2\. Carbon monoxide is a good reducing agent and can reduce many metal oxides to metals.

3\. Carbon monoixde is an important ligand and forms carbonyl compound with transition metals

### Carbon dioxide:


Carbon dioxide occurs in nature in free state as well as in the combined state. It is a constituent of air (0.03%). It occurs in rock as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.

**Production**

On industrial scale it is produced by burning coke in excess of air.

Carbon dioxide is prepared in laboratory by the action of dilute hydrochloric acid on metal carbonates.

CaCO3 + 2HCl CaCl2 + H2O + CO2

**Properties**

It is a colourless, nonflammable gas and is heavier than air. Its critical temperature is 31⁰ C and can be readily liquefied.

### Silicon tetrachloride:


**Preparation:**

Silicon tetrachloride can be prepared by passing dry chlorine over an intimate mixture of silica and carbon by heating to 1675 K in a porcelain tube

SiO2 + 2C + 2Cl2 SiCl4 + 2CO On commercial scale, reaction of silicon with hydrogen chloride gas occurs above 600 K

Si + 4HCl SiCl4 + 2H2

**Properties:**

Silicon tetrachloride is a colourless fuming liquid and it freezes at -70 ⁰C

In moist air, silicon tetrachloride is hydrolysed with water to give silica and hydrochloric acid.

SiCl4 + 2H2O 4HCl + SiO2

When silicon tetrachloride is hydrolysed with moist ether, linear perchloro siloxanes are formed \[Cl-(Si Cl2O)nSiCl3 where n=1-6.

**Alcoholysis**

The chloride ion in silicon tetrachloride can be substituted by nucleophile such as OH, OR, etc.. using suitable reagents. For example, it forms silicic esters with alcohols.

2\. It is used as a starting material in the synthesis of silica gel, silicic esters, a binder for ceramic materials.

### Silcones:
 Silicones or poly siloxanes are organo silicon polymers with general empirical formula

(R2SiO). Since their empirical formula is similar to that of ketone (R2CO), they were named “silicones”. These silicones may be linear or cross linked. Because of their very high thermal stability they are called high –temperature polymers.

**Preparation:**

Generally silicones are prepared by the hydrolysis of dialkyldichlorosilanes (R2SiCl2) or diaryldichlorosilanes Ar2SiCl2, which are prepared by passing vapours of RCl or ArCl over silicon at 570 K with copper as a catalyst.

**a) Silicone rubbers: These silicones are bridged together by methylene or similar groups**

**b) Silicone resins: They are obtained by blending silicones with organic resins such as acrylic** esters.

**(ii) Cyclic silicones**

These are obtained by the hydrolysis of R2SiCl2.

**(iii) Cross linked silicones**

They are obtained by hydrolysis of RSiCl3

**Properties**

The extent of cross linking and nature of alkyl group determine the nature of polymer. They range from oily liquids to rubber like solids. All silicones are water repellent. This property arises due to the presence of organic side groups that surrounds the silicon which makes the molecule looks like an alkane. They are also thermal and electrical insulators. Chemically they are inert. Lower silicones are oily liquids whereas higher silicones with long chain structure are waxy solids. The viscosity of silicon oil remains constant and doesn’t change with temperature and they don't thicken during winter

**Uses:**

1\. Silicones are used for low temperature lubrication and in vacuum pumps, high temperature oil baths etc...

2\. They are used for making water proofing clothes

3\. They are used as insulting material in electrical motor and other appliances

4\. They are mixed with paints and enamels to make them resistant towards high temperature, sunlight, dampness and chemicals.

### Silicates


The mineral which contains silicon and oxygen in tetrahedral \[SiO 4 \]4- units linked

together in different patterns are called silicates. Nearly 95 % of the earth crust is composed of silicate minerals and silica. The glass and ceramic industries are based on the chemistry silicates.

**Types of Silicates:**

Silicates are classified into various types based on the way in which the tetrahedral units, \[SiO

4 \]4- are linked together.

**Ortho silicates (Neso silicates): The simplest** silicates which contain discrete \[SiO

4 \]4-

tetrahedral units are called ortho silicates or neso silicates.

**Examples** : Phenacite - Be2SiO4 (Be2+ ions are tetrahedrally surrounded by O2- ions), Olivine - (Fe/Mg)2SiO4 ( Fe2+ and Mg2+ cations are octahedrally surrounded by O2- ions),

**Pyro silicate (or) Soro silicates):** Silicates which contain \[Si2O7\]

6- ions are called pyro silicates (or) Soro silicates. They are formed by joining two \[SiO

4 \]4-tetrahedral

units by sharing one oxygen atom at one corner.(one oxygen is removed while joining). Example : Thortveitite - Sc2Si2O7

**Cyclic silicates (or Ring silicates)**

Silicates which contain (SiO3)n 2n- ions

which are formed by linking three or more tetrahedral SiO4

4- units cyclically are called cyclic silicates. Each silicate unit shares two of its oxygen atoms with other units.

**Example:** Beryl \[Be3Al2 (SiO3)6\] (an aluminosilicate with each aluminium is surrounded by 6 oxygen atoms octahedrally)

**Inosilicates :**

Silicates which contain 'n' number of silicate units linked by sharing two or more oxygen atoms are called inosilicates. They are further classified as chain silicates and double chain silicates.

**Chain silicates (or pyroxenes): These** silicates contain \[(SiO3)

n\]2n- ions formed by linking ‘n’ number of tetrahedral \[SiO

4 \]4-units

linearly. Each silicate unit shares two of its oxygen atoms with other units.

**Example:** Spodumene - LiAl(SiO3)2.

**Double chain silicates (or amphiboles): These silicates contains \[Si4O11\]n** 6n- ions. In these

silicates there are two different types of tetrahedra : (i) Those sharing 3 vertices (ii) those sharing only 2 vertices.

**Examples:**

1) Asbestos: These are fibrous and non- combustible silicates. Therefore they are used for thermal insulation material, brake linings, construction material and filters. Asbestos being carcinogenic silicates, their applications are restricted.

**Sheet or phyllo silicates**

Silicates which contain (Si2O5)n

2n- are called sheet or phyllo silicates. In these, Each \[ S i O

unit shares three oxygen atoms with others and thus by forming two- dimensional sheets. These sheets silicates form layered structures in which silicate sheets are stacked over each other. The attractive forces between these layers are very weak, hence they can be cleaved easily just like graphite.

**Example:** Talc, Mica etc...

**Three dimensional silicates (or tecto silicates):**

Silicates in which all the oxygen atoms of \[SiO 4 \]4-tetrahedra are shared with other

tetrahedra to form three-dimensional network are called three dimensional or tecto silicates. They have general formula (SiO2)n .

**Examples:** Quartz

These tecto silicates can be converted into Three dimensional aluminosilicates by replacing \[SiO4\]

Zeolites are three-dimensional crystalline solids containing aluminium, silicon, and oxygen in their regular three dimensional framework. They are hydrated sodium alumino silicates with general formula Na2O.(Al2O3).x(SiO2).yH2O (x=2 to 10; y=2 to 6).

Zeolites have porous structure in which the monovalent sodium ions and water molecules are loosely held. The Si and Al atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated with each other through shared oxygen atoms. Zeolites are similar to clay minerals but they differ in their crystalline structure.

Zeolites have a three dimensional crystalline structure looks like a honeycomb consisting of a network of interconnected tunnels and cages. Water molecules moves freely in and out of these pores but the zeolite framework remains rigid. Another special aspect of this structure is that the pore/channel sizes are nearly uniform, allowing the crystal to act as a molecular sieve. We have already discussed in XI standard, the removal of permanent hardness of water using zeolites.

**Boron Neutron Capture Therapy:**

The affinity of Boron-10 for neutrons is the basis of a technique known as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for treating patients suffering from brain tumours.

It is based on the nuclear reaction that occurs when boron-10 is irradiated with low-energy thermal neutrons to give high linear energy α particles and a Li particle.

Boron compounds are injected into a patient with a brain tumour and the compounds collect preferentially in the tumour. The tumour area is then irradiated with thermal neutrons and results in the release of an alpha particle that damages the tissue in the tumour each time a boron-10 nucleus captures a neutron. In this way damage can be limited preferentially to the tumour, leaving the normal brain tissue less affected. BNCT has also been studied as a treatment for several other tumours of the head and neck, the breast, the prostate, the bladder, andthe liver.

**Summary**

„ The elements in which their last electron enters the 'p' orbital, constitute the p-block elements.

„ The p-block elements have a general electronic configuration of ns2, np1-6. The elements of each group have similar outer shell electronic configuration and differ only in the value of n (principal quantum number).

„ Generally on descending a group the ionisation energy decreases and hence the metallic character increases.

„ The ionisation enthalpy of elements in successive groups is higher than the corresponding elements of the previous group as expected.

„ As we move down the 13th group, the electronegativity first decreases from boron to aluminium and then marginally increases.

„ In p-block elements, the first member of each group differs from the other elements of the corresponding group.

„ In heavier post-transition metals, the outer s electrons (ns) have a tendency to remain inert and show reluctance to take part in the bonding, which is known as inert pair effect.

„ Some elements exist in more than one crystalline or molecular forms in the same physical state. For example, carbon exists as diamond and graphite. This phenomenon is called allothropism

„ Borax is a sodium salt of tetraboric acid. It is obtained from colemanite ore by boiling its solution with sodium carbonate.

„ Boric acid can be extracted from borax and colemanite.

„ Boric acid has a two dimensional layered structure.

„ The name alum is given to the double salt of potassium aluminium sulphate \[K2SO4. Al2(SO4)3.24.H2O\].

„ Carbon is found in the native form as graphite.

„ Silicon occurs as silica (sand and quartz crystal). Silicate minerals and clay are other important sources for silicon.

„ Catenation is an ability of an element to form chain of atoms

„ Carbon nanotubes, another recently discovered allotropes, have graphite like tubes with fullerene ends.

„ Silicones or poly siloxanes are organo silicon polymers with general empirical formula (R2SiO). Because of their very high thermal stability they are called high –temperature polymers.

„ The mineral which contains silicon and oxygen in tetrahedral \[SiO 4 \]4- units linked

together in different patterns are called silicates.

„ Types of Silicates:

▶ **Ortho silicates (Neso silicates), Pyro silicate (or) Soro silicates),** Cyclic silicates (or Ring silicates)

▶ Inosilicates : **Chain silicates (or pyroxenes), Double chain silicates (or amphiboles):**

▶ Sheet or phyllo silicates

▶ Three dimensional silicates (or tecto silicates)

„ Zeolites are three-dimensional crystalline solids containing aluminium, silicon, and oxygen in their regular three dimensional framework.

„ zeolites act as a molecular sieve for the removal of permanent hardness of water
