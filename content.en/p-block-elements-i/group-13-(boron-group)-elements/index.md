## Group 13 (Boron group) elements: 2.2.1 Occurrence:


The boron occurs mostly as borates and its important ores are borax - Na2\[B4O5(OH)4\].8H2O and kernite - Na2\[B4O5(OH)4\].2H2O.. Aluminium is the most abundant metal and occurs as oxides and also found in aluminosilicate rocks. Commercially it is extracted from its chief ore, bauxite (Al2O3.2H2O). The other elements of this group occur only in trace amounts. The other elements Ga, In and Tl occur as their sulphides.

### Chemical properties of boron:


Boron is the only nonmetal in this group and is less reactive. However, it shows reactivity at higher temperatures. Many of its compounds are electron deficient and has unusual type of covalent bonding which is due to its small size, high ionisation energy and similarity in electronegativity with carbon and hydrogen.

**Formation of metal borides:**

Many metals except alkali metals form borides with a general formula MxBy (x ranging upto 11 and y ranging upto 66 or higher)

**Direct combination of metals with boron:**

Cr + nB 1500 K CrBn

**Reduction of borontrihalides:**

Reduction of borontrichloride with a metal assisted by dihydrogen gives metal borides.

2BCl 3 + 2W 1500 K 2WB + 2Cl 2+2HCl H2

**Formation of hydrides:**

Boron does not react directly with hydrogen. However, it forms a variety of hydrides called boranes. The simplest borane is diborane - B2H6. Other larger boranes can be prepared from diborane. Treatment of gaseous boron trifluoride with sodium hydride around 450 K gives diborane. To prevent subsequent pyrolysis, the product diborane is trapped immediately.

2BF3 + 6NaH 450 K B2H6 + 6NaF

**Formation of boron trihalides:**

Boron combines with halogen to form boron trihalides at high temperatures.

**Structure of diborane:**

In diborane two BH2 units are linked by two bridged hydrogens. Therefore, it has eight B-H bonds. However, diborane has only 12 valance electrons and are not sufficient to form normal covalent bonds. The four terminal B-H bonds are normal covalent bonds (two centre - two electron bond or 2c-2e bond). The remaining four electrons have to be used for the bridged bonds. i.e. two three centred B-H-B bonds utilise two electrons each. Hence, these bonds are three centre- two electron bonds (3c-2e). The bridging hydrogen atoms are in a plane as shown in the figure 2.3. In diborane, the boron is sp3 hybridised.

Three of the four sp3 hybridised orbitals contains single electron and the fourth orbital is empty. Two of the half filled hybridised orbitals of each boron overlap with the 1s orbitals of two hydrogens to form four terminal 2c-2e bonds, leaving one empty and one half filled hybridised orbitals on each boron. The Three centre - two electron bonds), B-H-B bond formation involves overlapping the half filled hybridised orbital of one boron, the empty hybridised orbital of the other boron and the half filled 1s orbital of hydrogen.

**Uses of diborane:**

1\. Diborane is used as a high energy fuel for propellant

2\. It is used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry

3\. It is used in welding torches
